### **3. Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps**

#### **3.1 Introduction to Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**

A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is a specialized operating system designed to manage tasks with specific timing requirements. Unlike traditional operating systems, which focus on providing general-purpose multitasking capabilities, RTOSes prioritize tasks based on their deadlines and ensure that critical tasks are executed within their specified time constraints. This is crucial for applications where timing and reliability are paramount, such as in industrial control systems, automotive electronics, and medical devices.

**3.1.1 Basic Principles of RTOS**

The core principles of an RTOS include:

- **Task Scheduling**: The heart of an RTOS is its task scheduler, which determines the order in which tasks are executed. Common scheduling algorithms include priority-based scheduling, round-robin scheduling, and earliest deadline first (EDF).

- **Interrupt Management**: RTOSes must handle interrupts efficiently to ensure that time-critical tasks can be executed without delay. This involves configuring interrupt priorities and writing interrupt service routines (ISRs) that are as fast and efficient as possible.

- **Resource Management**: An RTOS must manage system resources, including CPU time, memory, and peripherals, to ensure optimal system performance. This includes memory allocation and deallocation, thread synchronization, and inter-process communication.

- **Synchronization**: To prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity, RTOSes provide synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables.

**3.1.2 Types of Real-Time Systems**

Real-time systems can be classified into two main categories based on their timing requirements:

- **Hard Real-Time Systems**: Hard real-time systems have strict timing constraints, and missing a deadline is considered a failure. These systems are often used in critical applications such as medical devices, aviation control systems, and automotive safety systems.

- **Soft Real-Time Systems**: Soft real-time systems have less strict timing constraints. While missing a deadline may not be critical, it can degrade system performance. Examples include multimedia processing, video games, and industrial automation systems.

#### **3.2 Designing and Implementing Real-Time Systems with ARM Cortex-M**

To design and implement an efficient real-time system using ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, several steps need to be followed:

**3.2.1 Hardware Selection**

The first step in designing an ARM Cortex-M real-time system is selecting the appropriate hardware. This involves considering the following factors:

- **Processor Performance**: Choose a Cortex-M core that meets the processing requirements of your application. For example, Cortex-M0+ is suitable for simple tasks, while Cortex-M7 is ideal for more complex applications.

- **Memory Size**: Ensure that the MCU has sufficient Flash and RAM to accommodate your application's code and data requirements.

- **Peripheral Set**: Select an MCU with the required peripherals, such as timers, UARTs, SPIs, I2Cs, and ADCs, to connect to sensors, actuators, and other devices.

- **Power Consumption**: For battery-powered devices, choose an MCU with low power consumption to maximize battery life.

**3.2.2 Software Design**

Once the hardware is selected, the next step is to design the software for the real-time system. This includes the following steps:

- **Task Definition**: Define the tasks that need to be executed by the system. Each task should have a specific function and timing requirements.

- **Scheduling Algorithm**: Choose a scheduling algorithm that best fits the timing requirements of your tasks. For example, priority-based scheduling is commonly used in hard real-time systems due to its ability to guarantee deadlines.

- **Interrupt Handling**: Implement efficient interrupt handling to ensure that time-critical tasks can be executed as quickly as possible. This involves configuring interrupt priorities and writing fast, concise ISR functions.

- **Resource Management**: Manage system resources effectively to prevent contention and ensure optimal performance. This includes managing memory allocations, synchronizing access to shared resources, and handling communication between tasks.

**3.2.3 Example: Implementing a Simple Real-Time System with ARM Cortex-M**

Let's consider a simple example of implementing a real-time system with an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. Suppose we want to create a system that reads temperature data from a sensor and sends it to a display at regular intervals.

1. **Task Definition**:

   - **Temperature Reading Task**: This task reads the temperature data from the sensor and stores it in a buffer.

   - **Display Update Task**: This task reads the temperature data from the buffer and updates the display.

2. **Scheduling Algorithm**:

   We can use a round-robin scheduling algorithm to ensure that both tasks are executed in a fair manner. However, since the display update task has a higher priority, it will be executed more frequently.

3. **Interrupt Handling**:

   The temperature sensor can trigger an interrupt when new data is available. The interrupt service routine (ISR) will read the data and store it in a buffer.

4. **Resource Management**:

   To ensure data integrity, we will use a semaphore to protect access to the shared buffer.

Here is a simplified example of the code structure:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "stm32f4xx.h"

// Define the buffer size and the buffer itself
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10
int temperature_buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
int buffer_index = 0;

// Semaphore for buffer access
SemaphoreHandle_t temperature_semaphore;

// Interrupt Service Routine for temperature sensor
void EXTI0_IRQHandler(void) {
    // Check if the interrupt is triggered
    if (EXTI->PR & EXTI_PR_PR0) {
        // Read temperature data from the sensor
        int temperature = read_temperature_sensor();

        // Lock the semaphore
        xSemaphoreTake(temperature_semaphore, portMAX_DELAY);

        // Store the temperature data in the buffer
        temperature_buffer[buffer_index++] = temperature;

        // Reset the buffer index if it reaches the end
        if (buffer_index == BUFFER_SIZE) {
            buffer_index = 0;
        }

        // Unlock the semaphore
        xSemaphoreGive(temperature_semaphore);
    }
    // Clear the interrupt pending bit
    EXTI->PR = EXTI_PR_PR0;
}

// Main function
int main(void) {
    // System initialization
    SystemClock_Config();
    initialize_temperature_sensor();
    initialize_display();

    // Create semaphore
    temperature_semaphore = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();

    // Create tasks
    xTaskCreate(temperature_reading_task, "Temperature Reading", 128, NULL, 2, NULL);
    xTaskCreate(display_update_task, "Display Update", 128, NULL, 1, NULL);

    // Start the scheduler
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    // Infinite loop
    while (1);
}

// Task functions
void temperature_reading_task(void *param) {
    while (1) {
        // Lock the semaphore
        xSemaphoreTake(temperature_semaphore, portMAX_DELAY);

        // Read the latest temperature from the buffer
        int temperature = temperature_buffer[buffer_index - 1];

        // Unlock the semaphore
        xSemaphoreGive(temperature_semaphore);

        // Do something with the temperature data (e.g., log it, send it to the display)
    }
}

void display_update_task(void *param) {
    while (1) {
        // Read the latest temperature from the buffer
        xSemaphoreTake(temperature_semaphore, portMAX_DELAY);
        int temperature = temperature_buffer[buffer_index - 1];
        xSemaphoreGive(temperature_semaphore);

        // Update the display with the temperature
        update_display(temperature);

        // Delay for the next update
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic principles of designing and implementing a real-time system with ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers and FreeRTOS. The temperature reading task reads data from the sensor and stores it in a buffer, while the display update task reads the data from the buffer and updates the display. The use of a binary semaphore ensures that access to the buffer is synchronized between the tasks.

### **4. Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustration**

#### **4.1 Model of Interrupt Latency**

Interrupt latency refers to the time between the occurrence of an interrupt event and the start of the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR). It is a critical metric in real-time systems, as it determines how quickly the system can respond to external events. The interrupt latency model can be expressed using the following formula:

\[ L = t_{response} + t_{ISR} \]

Where:
- \( L \) is the interrupt latency.
- \( t_{response} \) is the time taken for the CPU to respond to the interrupt.
- \( t_{ISR} \) is the time taken to execute the ISR.

**Example Illustration**:

Consider a system where the CPU response time is 1 μs and the ISR execution time is 5 μs. Using the above formula, the interrupt latency is:

\[ L = 1\mu s + 5\mu s = 6\mu s \]

#### **4.2 Model of Task Scheduling**

Task scheduling is a fundamental aspect of real-time systems, involving the allocation of CPU time to different tasks based on their priority and deadlines. The scheduling model can be described using the following components:

- **Task Set**: A collection of tasks that need to be scheduled.
- **Task Characteristics**: Each task has characteristics such as priority, execution time, and deadline.
- **Scheduling Algorithm**: A method for determining the order in which tasks are executed.

**Scheduling Model**:

\[ S = P \times D \]

Where:
- \( S \) is the schedule.
- \( P \) is the priority assignment.
- \( D \) is the deadline.

**Example Illustration**:

Suppose we have three tasks with the following characteristics:

| Task | Priority (P) | Execution Time (T) | Deadline (D) |
|------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|
| T1   | 1            | 5ms                | 10ms         |
| T2   | 2            | 10ms               | 20ms         |
| T3   | 3            | 15ms               | 30ms         |

Using the earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling algorithm, the schedule can be expressed as:

\[ S = \{ T1 \rightarrow T2 \rightarrow T3 \} \]

#### **4.3 Model of Memory Management**

Memory management is crucial for efficient resource utilization in real-time systems. It involves allocating and deallocating memory dynamically to tasks. The memory management model can be described using the following components:

- **Memory Pool**: A block of memory allocated for task usage.
- **Memory Allocation Algorithm**: A method for allocating memory to tasks.
- **Memory Deallocation Algorithm**: A method for releasing memory after task completion.

**Memory Management Model**:

\[ M = A \times D \]

Where:
- \( M \) is the memory usage.
- \( A \) is the memory allocation algorithm.
- \( D \) is the memory deallocation algorithm.

**Example Illustration**:

Consider a memory pool of 1 MB. Using a first-fit allocation algorithm and a free list deallocation algorithm, the memory management can be expressed as:

\[ M = \{ \text{Allocate: First-Fit} \rightarrow \text{Deallocate: Free List} \} \]

#### **4.4 Example of Mathematical Analysis of Task Scheduling**

Let's analyze a real-time system using the rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS) algorithm. RMS assigns priorities to tasks based on their period (rate) in descending order. We will use the following formula to analyze the system's schedulability:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} \leq \frac{N}{P} \]

Where:
- \( C_i \) is the execution time of task i.
- \( T_i \) is the period of task i.
- \( N \) is the number of processors.
- \( P \) is the processor utilization factor.

**Example Illustration**:

Suppose we have a system with two processors and the following tasks:

| Task | Execution Time (C) | Period (T) |
|------|--------------------|------------|
| T1   | 5ms                | 20ms       |
| T2   | 10ms               | 30ms       |
| T3   | 15ms               | 40ms       |

Using the RMS algorithm, the priorities are assigned as follows:

\[ \{ T3 \rightarrow T2 \rightarrow T1 \} \]

The processor utilization factor for each task is:

\[ \frac{C_i}{T_i} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \]
\[ \frac{C_i}{T_i} = \frac{10}{30} = 0.33 \]
\[ \frac{C_i}{T_i} = \frac{15}{40} = 0.375 \]

The total utilization is:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} = 0.25 + 0.33 + 0.375 = 0.95 \]

For a two-processor system, the processor utilization factor should not exceed:

\[ \frac{N}{P} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \]

Since the total utilization (0.95) is less than the maximum utilization (2), the system is schedulable.

#### **5.3 Code Explanation and Analysis**

The provided code demonstrates a simple embedded real-time system that reads analog voltage from an ADC and sends it over a UART. Let's go through the code and explain each part:

1. **Header Files**:

   The code includes necessary header files for the STM32 HAL library, FreeRTOS, and standard C functions. These headers provide the required functions and definitions for the microcontroller and the RTOS.

2. **System Initialization**:

   The `SystemClock_Config` function configures the system clock to the desired frequency. This is essential for proper operation of the microcontroller and its peripherals.

3. **ADC and UART Initialization**:

   The `ADC_Init` and `UART_Init` functions configure the ADC and UART peripherals, respectively. These functions are generated by STM32CubeMX and provide the necessary initialization code for the selected peripherals.

4. **Error Handler**:

   The `Error_Handler` function is a standard error handling routine provided by the HAL library. It is called when an error occurs during the initialization or execution of the system.

5. **Main Function**:

   The `main` function initializes the system, creates the required tasks, and starts the FreeRTOS scheduler. The main loop runs indefinitely, waiting for the tasks to complete their execution.

6. **ADC Reading Task**:
