### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that form the foundation of UAV flight control algorithms. These models and formulas are essential for understanding the principles and operations of various flight control algorithms. We will provide detailed explanations and examples to help readers grasp the concepts more effectively.

#### 3.1.1 Attitude Control Model

The attitude control model is critical for maintaining the stability of the UAV. It involves the control of the UAV's roll, pitch, and yaw angles. The mathematical representation of the attitude control model is as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau_r &= K_r \cdot (r_d - r_s), \\
\tau_p &= K_p \cdot (p_d - p_s), \\
\tau_y &= K_y \cdot (y_d - y_s),
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau_r$, $\tau_p$, and $\tau_y$ are the control torques applied to the roll, pitch, and yaw axes, respectively. $r_d$, $p_d$, and $y_d$ are the desired roll, pitch, and yaw angles, while $r_s$, $p_s$, and $y_s$ are the current roll, pitch, and yaw angles. $K_r$, $K_p$, and $K_y$ are the gain constants for each axis.

**Example:**
Suppose we have a quadrotor UAV with a desired roll angle of 15 degrees and a current roll angle of 12 degrees. The gain constants are $K_r = 2$, $K_p = 1$, and $K_y = 1.5$. We can calculate the required control torques as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tau_r &= 2 \cdot (15 - 12) = 6 \text{ Nm}, \\
\tau_p &= 1 \cdot (0 - 0) = 0 \text{ Nm}, \\
\tau_y &= 1.5 \cdot (0 - 0) = 0 \text{ Nm}.
\end{align*}
$$

These torques will be applied to the corresponding motors to achieve the desired roll angle.

#### 3.1.2 Navigation Model

The navigation model is responsible for determining the position and direction of the UAV. It typically involves the use of path planning algorithms such as A* or Dijkstra. The basic formula for path planning is:

$$
c(s') < c(s)
$$

where $c(s')$ is the cost of reaching the goal from state $s'$, and $c(s)$ is the cost of reaching the goal from state $s$. The algorithm iteratively explores the state space, updating the cost function until the optimal path is found.

**Example:**
Consider a simple grid with start point $s = (0, 0)$ and goal point $s' = (5, 5)$. Let's use the A* algorithm to find the optimal path. The cost function is defined as $c(s') = 10$, and the cost of moving to an adjacent cell is $c(s) = 1$. The optimal path is $(0, 0) \rightarrow (0, 1) \rightarrow (0, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (3, 2) \rightarrow (4, 2) \rightarrow (5, 2) \rightarrow (5, 3) \rightarrow (5, 4) \rightarrow (5, 5)$.

#### 3.1.3 Obstacle Avoidance Model

The obstacle avoidance model is designed to detect and avoid obstacles in the path of the UAV. A common approach is to use a distance sensor to measure the distance to the nearest obstacle. The formula for obstacle avoidance is:

$$
d > d_0
$$

where $d$ is the measured distance to the obstacle, and $d_0$ is the safe distance. If the measured distance is less than the safe distance, the UAV will adjust its path to avoid the obstacle.

**Example:**
Suppose the UAV measures a distance of $d = 0.5$ meters to the nearest obstacle, and the safe distance is $d_0 = 1$ meter. Since $d < d_0$, the UAV will adjust its path to avoid the obstacle by taking a detour.

#### 3.1.4 Mission Execution Model

The mission execution model involves the execution of specific tasks, such as object detection or data collection. A common approach is to use a machine learning model to classify the objects or data. The formula for mission execution is:

$$
p > \theta
$$

where $p$ is the probability of correct classification, and $\theta$ is the threshold probability. If the probability of correct classification is greater than the threshold probability, the task is considered completed.

**Example:**
A machine learning model classifies an object with a probability of $p = 0.9$, and the threshold probability is $\theta = 0.8$. Since $p > \theta$, the object is correctly classified, and the mission is completed.

These mathematical models and formulas provide a solid foundation for understanding and implementing UAV flight control algorithms. By understanding these models, engineers can design more effective and reliable algorithms for controlling and operating UAVs.

#### 5.3 Code Interpretation and Analysis

**Example 1: Attitude Control Algorithm Interpretation**

This example demonstrates how to use a PID controller for attitude control. First, we define a `AttitudeController` class, initialized with proportional, integral, and derivative coefficients. The `update` method calculates the control signal based on the current error, error derivative, and error integral.

- **Error Calculation**: `error = np.linalg.norm(gyro_data - accel_data)` calculates the Euclidean distance between the gyro and accelerometer data, representing the deviation between the current and desired attitude.
- **Error Derivative**: `error_derivative = (error - previous_error) / time_step` calculates the rate of change of the error over time, reflecting the trend of attitude change.
- **Error Integral**: `integral = np.trapz(np.sin(np.linspace(0, time_step, num=100)), x=np.linspace(0, time_step, num=100))` calculates the integral of the error over a period of time, used to accumulate the error and improve system stability.

**Example 2: Navigation Algorithm Interpretation**

This example demonstrates how to use the A* algorithm for path planning. The `heuristic` function calculates the heuristic distance between two nodes, and `get_neighbors` function retrieves the neighboring nodes of a given node. The `a_star_search` function implements the core logic of the A* algorithm, gradually searching for the optimal path by iteration.

- **Heuristic Distance**: `heuristic(a, b)` uses the Euclidean distance as the heuristic distance, which is a simple heuristic function suitable for two-dimensional spaces.
- **Path Planning**: `a_star_search` function uses a priority queue (open_set) to store the nodes to be visited and calculates the priority based on heuristic distance and actual distance, gradually searching for the optimal path.

**Example 3: Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm Interpretation**

This example demonstrates how to detect obstacles using LiDAR data. The `distance_to_obstacle` function calculates the minimum distance in the LiDAR data, and `detect_obstacles` function filters out obstacles based on a set threshold.

- **Obstacle Detection**: `distance_to_obstacle(lidar_data)` gets the minimum distance in the LiDAR data, representing the distance between the current point and the nearest obstacle.
- **Threshold Setting**: `threshold = 2` sets a safe distance threshold. If the measured distance is less than the threshold, it is considered there is an obstacle.
