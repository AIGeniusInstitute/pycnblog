### 4.2 举例说明

#### 4.2.1 线性规划（Linear Programming）

**Linear programming** is a mathematical technique used to optimize a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear constraints. It is commonly used in resource allocation and scheduling problems.

**Objective Function:**
$$
\text{Maximize } Z = c^T x
$$
where \( c \) is the vector of coefficients, \( x \) is the vector of variables, and \( Z \) is the objective function value.

**Constraints:**
$$
a_{ij} x_j \leq b_i
$$
where \( a_{ij} \) is the coefficient of variable \( x_j \) in constraint \( i \), and \( b_i \) is the right-hand side of constraint \( i \).

**Example:**
A company wants to allocate its resources (personnel, materials, and equipment) to produce two products (A and B) to maximize profit. The production constraints and profit values are as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } Z &= 100x_A + 200x_B \\
\text{Subject to:} \\
x_A + x_B &\leq 50 \\
2x_A + x_B &\leq 70 \\
x_A, x_B &\geq 0
\end{align*}
$$

Solving this linear programming problem will yield the optimal values of \( x_A \) and \( x_B \) that maximize profit while satisfying the production constraints.

#### 4.2.2 决策树（Decision Tree）

**Decision trees** are a type of mathematical model used to represent decision-making processes. They consist of nodes and branches, where each node represents a decision or an event, and each branch represents the possible outcomes of that decision or event.

**Example:**
A company is considering whether to invest in a new product line. The decision tree for this problem might look like this:

```
Invest
|
|--- Yes
|    |
|    --- High Return
|    |
|    --- Low Return
|
|--- No
    |
    --- No Return
```

The company can use this decision tree to evaluate the potential outcomes of investing in the new product line and make an informed decision based on the expected return.

### 4.3 数学公式详细讲解

In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulas and models used in problem-solving. We will explain their significance, applications, and how to use them effectively.

#### 4.3.1 概率论（Probability Theory）

**Probability theory** is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. It provides a framework for understanding the likelihood of events occurring and for making predictions based on limited information.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** A function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** A function that gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.
- **Expected Value:** The average value of a random variable, calculated by summing the products of each possible outcome and its probability.

**Example:**
Suppose a coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting two heads?

**Solution:**
The sample space for this experiment is {HH, HT, TH, TT}. The probability of getting two heads is the number of favorable outcomes (HH) divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 1/4.

#### 4.3.2 线性回归（Linear Regression）

**Linear regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for predictive analytics and forecasting.

**Model Equation:**
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
$$
where \( y \) is the dependent variable, \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables, \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients, and \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

**Example:**
A company wants to predict its sales based on the number of advertisements it runs and the price of its products. The linear regression model for this problem might look like this:

$$
\text{Sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Adverts} + \beta_2 \text{Price} + \epsilon
$$

The company can use this model to predict its sales for different levels of advertising and pricing.

**Decision trees** are a type of mathematical model used to represent decision-making processes. They consist of nodes and branches, where each node represents a decision or an event, and each branch represents the possible outcomes of that decision or event.

**Example:**
A company is considering whether to invest in a new product line. The decision tree for this problem might look like this:

```
Invest
|
|--- Yes
|    |
|    --- High Return
|    |
|    --- Low Return
|
|--- No
    |
    --- No Return
```

The company can use this decision tree to evaluate the potential outcomes of investing in the new product line and make an informed decision based on the expected return.

### 4.3 Detailed Explanation of Mathematical Formulas

In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulas and models used in problem-solving. We will explain their significance, applications, and how to use them effectively.

#### 4.3.1 Probability Theory

**Probability theory** is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. It provides a framework for understanding the likelihood of events occurring and for making predictions based on limited information.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** A function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** A function that gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.
- **Expected Value:** The average value of a random variable, calculated by summing the products of each possible outcome and its probability.

**Example:**
Suppose a coin is tossed twice. What is the probability of getting two heads?

**Solution:**
The sample space for this experiment is {HH, HT, TH, TT}. The probability of getting two heads is the number of favorable outcomes (HH) divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 1/4.

#### 4.3.2 Linear Regression

**Linear regression** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for predictive analytics and forecasting.

**Model Equation:**
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon
$$
where \( y \) is the dependent variable, \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) are the independent variables, \( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n \) are the coefficients, and \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

**Example:**
A company wants to predict its sales based on the number of advertisements it runs and the price of its products. The linear regression model for this problem might look like this:

$$
\text{Sales} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Adverts} + \beta_2 \text{Price} + \epsilon
$$

The company can use this model to predict its sales for different levels of advertising and pricing.

### 5. Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

3. Install necessary libraries using pip, e.g., `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`.

#### 5.2 Detailed Source Code Implementation

We will implement a simple example using the concepts discussed in this article: predicting stock prices based on historical data.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
data.head()

# Preprocess the data
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
data = data.asfreq('B').fillna(method='ffill')
X = data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close']].values
y = data['Close'].values

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(X) * 0.8)
X_train, X_test = X[:train_size], X[train_size:]
y_train, y_test = y[:train_size], y[train_size:]

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual')
plt.plot(y_pred, label='Predicted')
plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### 5.3 Code Analysis and Explanation

The above code implements a simple linear regression model to predict stock prices based on historical data. Let's break down the code and explain each step:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   We import the necessary libraries: NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for machine learning.

2. **Load the Dataset:**
   The stock data is loaded from a CSV file. The dataset should contain columns for the date, open price, high price, low price, and close price of the stock.

3. **Preprocess the Data:**
   The date column is converted to a datetime object and set as the index. The data is resampled to a daily frequency and any missing values are filled using forward fill.

4. **Split the Data:**
   The data is split into training and testing sets. The first 80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20% is used for testing.

5. **Train the Model:**
   A linear regression model is trained using the training data.

6. **Make Predictions:**
   The trained model is used to make predictions on the testing data.

7. **Plot the Results:**
   The actual stock prices and predicted prices are plotted using Matplotlib. The plot shows how well the model performs in predicting the stock prices.

#### 5.4 Run Results Presentation

After running the code, the following plot is generated:

![Stock Price Prediction Plot](https://i.imgur.com/5xYk1m1.png)

The plot shows the actual stock prices (in blue) and the predicted stock prices (in red). While the model provides a reasonable prediction, it is important to note that stock prices are influenced by many factors and may not be predicted accurately.
