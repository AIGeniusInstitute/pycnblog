## 4. 数学模型和公式 & 详细讲解 & 举例说明

在产品经理与开发团队的高效协作中，数学模型和公式可以用于量化协作效率和项目进展。以下是一些常用的数学模型和公式，以及它们的详细讲解和举例说明。

### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Demonstrations

In the efficient collaboration between product managers and development teams, mathematical models and formulas can be used to quantify collaboration efficiency and project progress. Here are some commonly used mathematical models and their detailed explanations along with example demonstrations:

### 4.1 Collaboration Efficiency Index

#### Definition

The Collaboration Efficiency Index (CEI) measures the effectiveness of collaboration between product managers and developers. It is calculated as the ratio of the actual work completed to the total work planned.

#### Formula

CEI = (Actual Work Completed / Total Work Planned) × 100

#### Example

假设一个项目计划需要10人天来完成，实际完成工作用了8人天。则CEI = (8 / 10) × 100 = 80%。

#### Interpretation

A CEI above 100% indicates that the team is working faster than planned, while a CEI below 100% suggests that the team is falling behind schedule. A consistent high CEI indicates efficient collaboration.

### 4.2 Project Progress Rate

#### Definition

The Project Progress Rate (PPR) measures the percentage of project completion based on the elapsed time.

#### Formula

PPR = (Elapsed Time / Total Project Duration) × 100

#### Example

If a project is estimated to take 6 months and has been in progress for 3 months, then PPR = (3 / 6) × 100 = 50%.

#### Interpretation

A PPR of 100% indicates that the project is on schedule. A PPR above 100% suggests that the project is ahead of schedule, while a PPR below 100% indicates that the project is behind schedule.

### 4.3 Workload Distribution Ratio

#### Definition

The Workload Distribution Ratio (WDR) measures how evenly the workload is distributed among team members.

#### Formula

WDR = (Average Workload / Total Team Workload) × 100

#### Example

If a team of 5 members has an average workload of 2 person-days per member and the total team workload is 10 person-days, then WDR = (2 / 10) × 100 = 20%.

#### Interpretation

A WDR close to 100% indicates that the workload is evenly distributed, while a WDR significantly below 100% suggests that some team members are overworked, and others are underutilized.

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python
- SQLite, a lightweight database engine

#### Steps

1. Install Python and Flask:

```bash
pip install python
pip install flask
```

2. Install SQLite:

```bash
pip install pysqlite3
```

### 5.2 源代码详细实现

The source code for the task management application is divided into several modules, including the database model, API endpoints, and the web interface. Below is a detailed explanation of each module.

#### 5.2.1 Database Model

The database model is defined using SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for Python. It allows us to interact with the SQLite database using Python objects.

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Task(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False, default='pending')
    due_date = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=True)
```

#### 5.2.2 API Endpoints

The API endpoints are implemented using Flask. These endpoints allow the product manager to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from models import db, Task

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///tasks.db'
db.init_app(app)

@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def create_task():
    data = request.get_json()
    new_task = Task(
        title=data['title'],
        description=data['description'],
        status=data['status'],
        due_date=data['due_date']
    )
    db.session.add(new_task)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(new_task.id), 201

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_task(task_id):
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        return jsonify({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title, 'description': task.description, 'status': task.status, 'due_date': task.due_date}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_task(task_id):
    data = request.get_json()
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        task.title = data['title']
        task.description = data['description']
        task.status = data['status']
        task.due_date = data['due_date']
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({'message': 'Task updated successfully'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_task(task_id):
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        db.session.delete(task)
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({'message': 'Task deleted successfully'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### 5.2.3 Web Interface

The web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the product manager to interact with the API endpoints and manage tasks.

### 5.3 代码解读与分析

In this section, we'll analyze the code and explain its functionality in detail. This will include discussing the database model, API endpoints, and the web interface.

#### 5.3.1 Database Model

The database model is defined using SQLAlchemy. It is responsible for creating the `Task` table in the SQLite database. The `Task` class represents a task with properties such as `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, and `due_date`.

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Task(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    status = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False, default='pending')
    due_date = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=True)
```

#### 5.3.2 API Endpoints

The API endpoints are implemented using Flask. There are four main endpoints:

- `/tasks` (POST): Creates a new task.
- `/tasks/<int:task_id>` (GET): Retrieves a specific task by its ID.
- `/tasks/<int:task_id>` (PUT): Updates a specific task by its ID.
- `/tasks/<int:task_id>` (DELETE): Deletes a specific task by its ID.

Here's a breakdown of each endpoint:

- **Create Task (`/tasks`)**: This endpoint accepts a JSON payload containing the task details (title, description, status, due date). It creates a new `Task` object, adds it to the database, and returns the task ID.

```python
@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def create_task():
    data = request.get_json()
    new_task = Task(
        title=data['title'],
        description=data['description'],
        status=data['status'],
        due_date=data['due_date']
    )
    db.session.add(new_task)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(new_task.id), 201
```

- **Get Task (`/tasks/<int:task_id>`)**: This endpoint retrieves a specific task from the database based on its ID. It returns the task details in JSON format.

```python
@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_task(task_id):
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        return jsonify({'id': task.id, 'title': task.title, 'description': task.description, 'status': task.status, 'due_date': task.due_date}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404
```

- **Update Task (`/tasks/<int:task_id>`)**: This endpoint updates a specific task by its ID. It accepts a JSON payload with the new task details and updates the corresponding task in the database.

```python
@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_task(task_id):
    data = request.get_json()
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        task.title = data['title']
        task.description = data['description']
        task.status = data['status']
        task.due_date = data['due_date']
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({'message': 'Task updated successfully'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404
```

- **Delete Task (`/tasks/<int:task_id>`)**: This endpoint deletes a specific task from the database based on its ID.

```python
@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_task(task_id):
    task = Task.query.get(task_id)
    if task:
        db.session.delete(task)
        db.session.commit()
        return jsonify({'message': 'Task deleted successfully'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Task not found'}), 404
```

#### 5.3.3 Web Interface

The web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the product manager to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. The interface is divided into a form for creating tasks and a container for displaying the tasks.

The form has fields for the task title, description, status, and due date. When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to the `/tasks` endpoint with the task details. The JavaScript code listens for the form submission, makes the request, and then displays the new task in the tasks container.

```html
<form id="task-form">
    <label for="title">Title:</label>
    <input type="text" id="title" required>
    <label for="description">Description:</label>
    <textarea id="description"></textarea>
    <label for="status">Status:</label>
    <select id="status">
        <option value="pending">Pending</option>
        <option value="in_progress">In Progress</option>
        <option value="completed">Completed</option>
    </select>
    <label for="due_date">Due Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="due_date">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<div id="tasks">
    <!-- Tasks will be displayed here -->
</div>
```

The JavaScript code fetches the tasks from the `/tasks` endpoint and displays them in the tasks container. It also listens for updates to the tasks and refreshes the container when changes are made.

```javascript
function displayTasks() {
    fetch('/tasks')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        const tasksContainer = document.getElementById('tasks');
        tasksContainer.innerHTML = '';
        data.forEach(task => {
            const taskElement = document.createElement('div');
            taskElement.className = 'task';
            taskElement.innerHTML = `
                <h3>${task.title}</h3>
                <p>${task.description}</p>
                <p>Status: ${task.status}</p>
                <p>Due Date: ${task.due_date}</p>
            `;
            tasksContainer.appendChild(taskElement);
        });
    });
}

document.getElementById('task-form').onsubmit = function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const title = document.getElementById('title').value;
    const description = document.getElementById('description').value;
    const status = document.getElementById('status').value;
    const due_date = document.getElementById('due_date').value;
    fetch('/tasks', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ title, description, status, due_date })
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log('Success:', data);
        // Refresh the tasks list
        displayTasks();
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
};

// Initial display of tasks
displayTasks();
```
