### Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

In this section, we delve into the core algorithms used in smartwatch attention management, focusing on their principles and operational steps. These algorithms are designed to analyze sensor data, identify attention patterns, and provide actionable insights to help users maintain focus.

#### 1. Accelerometer Data Analysis

Accelerometers are one of the most commonly used sensors in smartwatch attention management. They measure acceleration forces and motion, providing valuable information about the user's activity levels and posture. Accelerometer data analysis involves the following steps:

- **Data Collection**: The accelerometer collects raw acceleration data at a fixed sampling rate.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw acceleration data is preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. This may involve filtering techniques such as low-pass filters or wavelet decomposition.
- **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed data, such as mean, variance, and power spectral density. These features are used to represent the user's activity levels and posture.

- **Stress and Attention Estimation**: Machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or gradient boosting, are trained on labeled datasets to estimate the user's stress levels based on the extracted features. Stress levels are then used to estimate attention levels, with higher stress levels typically associated with lower attention.

#### 3. Electrodermal Activity Data Analysis

Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors on smartwatches measure the electrical conductivity of the skin, providing information about the user's emotional and cognitive state. EDA data analysis involves the following steps:

- **Data Collection**: The EDA sensor collects raw EDA data at a fixed sampling rate.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw EDA data is preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. This may involve filtering techniques such as high-pass filters or wavelet denoising.

- **User Interaction**: The user can interact with the smartwatch to accept or dismiss recommendations, providing feedback on the effectiveness of the suggestions.

### Mathematical Models and Formulas

In this section, we present the mathematical models and formulas used in smartwatch attention management, providing a detailed explanation and examples to enhance understanding.

#### 1. Accelerometer Data Analysis

**Filtering Techniques**

Filtering is an essential step in accelerometer data analysis to remove noise and artifacts. One commonly used filtering technique is the low-pass filter, which allows low-frequency components to pass through while attenuating high-frequency noise.

**Formula:**

$$ y(t) = \frac{1}{T} \int_{t-T}^{t} x(\tau) d\tau $$

where:

- \( y(t) \) is the filtered signal.
- \( x(\tau) \) is the raw acceleration signal.
- \( T \) is the filter time constant.

**Example:**

Consider a raw acceleration signal with a time constant of 10 seconds. Using a low-pass filter with a time constant of 2 seconds, we can filter the signal as follows:

```plaintext
t      x(t)   y(t)
0      5      5
1      3      4.5
2      7      5.25
3      2      3.75
4      6      4.875
5      8      5.625
```

#### 2. Heart Rate Data Analysis

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**

Heart rate variability is a measure of the variation in the time interval between successive heartbeats. It is commonly used to assess the user's autonomic nervous system activity and stress levels.

**Formula:**

$$ HRV = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |R_i - \bar{R}| $$

where:

- \( HRV \) is the heart rate variability.
- \( N \) is the number of heart rate intervals.
- \( R_i \) is the duration of the \( i \)-th heart rate interval.
- \( \bar{R} \) is the mean heart rate interval.

**Example:**

Consider a user's heart rate data with the following intervals between heartbeats:

```plaintext
R_i
0.8
0.9
1.0
0.95
1.1
0.85
```

The heart rate variability can be calculated as follows:

```plaintext
HRV = \frac{1}{7} (0.2 + 0.1 + 0.0 + 0.05 + 0.15 + 0.05) = 0.1
```

#### 3. Electrodermal Activity Data Analysis

**EDA Features**

Electrodermal activity (EDA) data is analyzed using various features, such as mean EDA amplitude and EDA frequency.

**Formula:**

**Mean EDA Amplitude:**

$$ \mu_{EDA} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |EDA_i| $$

where:

- \( \mu_{EDA} \) is the mean EDA amplitude.
- \( N \) is the number of EDA samples.
- \( EDA_i \) is the amplitude of the \( i \)-th EDA sample.

**EDA Frequency:**

$$ f_{EDA} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{sign}(EDA_i - EDA_{i-1}) $$

where:

- \( f_{EDA} \) is the EDA frequency.
- \( T \) is the time interval between consecutive EDA samples.
- \( \text{sign}(x) \) is the sign function, which returns 1 if \( x > 0 \), -1 if \( x < 0 \), and 0 if \( x = 0 \).

**Example:**

Consider a sequence of EDA samples:

```plaintext
EDA_i
2
3
4
3
2
1
```

The mean EDA amplitude and EDA frequency can be calculated as follows:

```plaintext
\mu_{EDA} = \frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1}{6} = 2.5
f_{EDA} = \frac{1 + 1 + 1 - 1 - 1}{4} = 0.5
```
