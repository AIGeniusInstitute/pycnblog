### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

#### Mathematical Model 1: Satellite Orbit Equations

The equations used to calculate the orbit of a satellite revolve around the vis-viva equation, which relates the velocity of a satellite to its distance from the center of mass of the celestial body it is orbiting.

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{r}} $$

where:

- \( v \) is the velocity of the satellite
- \( \mu \) is the gravitational parameter, which depends on the mass of the celestial body
- \( r \) is the distance between the satellite and the center of mass of the celestial body

Example: Calculate the velocity of a satellite orbiting Earth at a distance of 350 km above the surface of Earth. Assuming the gravitational parameter of Earth (\( \mu \)) is \( 3.986 \times 10^{5} \) km\(^3\) s\(^{-2}\).

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{3.986 \times 10^{5} \text{ km}^3 \text{ s}^{-2}}{350 \text{ km}}} = 7.8 \text{ km/s} $$

#### Mathematical Model 2: Signal Propagation Time

The time it takes for a signal to travel from a satellite to a ground station can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ t = \frac{2d}{c} $$

where:

- \( t \) is the signal propagation time
- \( d \) is the distance between the satellite and the ground station
- \( c \) is the speed of light (approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s)

Example: Calculate the signal propagation time for a satellite in a geostationary orbit (35,786 km above Earth's surface) to a ground station on the Earth's surface.

$$ t = \frac{2 \times 35786 \text{ km}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 0.236 \text{ s} $$

#### Mathematical Model 3: Satellite Antenna Gain

The gain of a satellite antenna is a measure of its ability to focus the received signal and can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ G = \frac{4\pi \rho^2}{\lambda^2} $$

where:

- \( G \) is the antenna gain
- \( \rho \) is the radius of the antenna's main lobe
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the transmitted signal

Example: Calculate the gain of a satellite antenna with a radius of 1 m and operating at a frequency of 20 GHz.

$$ \lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}}{20 \times 10^9 \text{ Hz}} = 0.015 \text{ m} $$
$$ G = \frac{4\pi \times (0.5 \text{ m})^2}{(0.015 \text{ m})^2} = 3.35 \times 10^4 \text{ dB} $$

### Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanation

#### 1. 开发环境搭建（Setting up the Development Environment）

To develop space technology applications, you will need a suitable development environment. Here are the steps to set up a development environment for space technology projects:

1. Install a programming language such as Python or C++.
2. Install a version control system such as Git.
3. Set up a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse.
4. Install necessary libraries and tools, such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for Python or OpenCV, PCL for C++.

#### 2. 源代码详细实现（Detailed Source Code Implementation）

Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the orbit of a satellite using the vis-viva equation:

```python
import math

def calculate_satellite_velocity(mu, r):
    v = math.sqrt(mu / r)
    return v

mu = 3.986e5 # Gravitational parameter of Earth (km^3/s^2)
r = 350e3 # Distance from Earth's surface (km)

v = calculate_satellite_velocity(mu, r)
print(f"The velocity of the satellite is {v} km/s")
```

#### 3. 代码解读与分析（Code Explanation and Analysis）

The code above calculates the velocity of a satellite orbiting Earth at a given altitude using the vis-viva equation. The `calculate_satellite_velocity` function takes two arguments: the gravitational parameter of Earth (\( \mu \)) and the distance from Earth's surface (\( r \)). It then calculates the velocity using the vis-viva equation and returns the result.

The main part of the code defines the gravitational parameter of Earth and the altitude of the satellite and then calls the `calculate_satellite_velocity` function to calculate the velocity. The result is then printed to the console.

#### 4. 运行结果展示（Displaying Running Results）

When running the above code, you should see the following output:

```
The velocity of the satellite is 7.8 km/s
```

This indicates that the satellite is orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.8 km/s.
