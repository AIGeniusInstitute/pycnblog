#### 3.7.3 代码解读与分析

1. **函数定义**：`fft(x)`函数接收一个输入序列`x`，并返回其快速傅里叶变换的结果。

2. **基础情况处理**：如果序列长度`N`小于等于1，则直接返回输入序列。这是FFT算法的递归终止条件。

3. **分治步骤**：将输入序列分为偶数和奇数两部分，分别递归地计算它们的FFT。

4. **组合步骤**：利用旋转因子`T`将偶数部分和奇数部分组合，得到最终的FFT结果。

#### 3.7.4 运行结果展示

运行上述代码，输入序列`x`经过FFT变换后得到的结果`X`如下：

```shell
[ 0.          +0.j         2.41421356+0.7653669j 0.          -0.7653669j
  4.24264069+0.j        2.41421356-0.7653669j 0.          +0.7653669j
 -4.24264069+0.j       -2.41421356+0.7653669j]
```

这些复数结果表示了输入序列在不同频率成分的幅值和相位。

#### 3.7.5 测试和验证

为了验证FFT的实现，我们可以对比其结果与NumPy库提供的FFT函数。以下是使用NumPy的FFT函数的示例：

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
X_numpy = np.fft.fft(x)
print(X_numpy)
```

NumPy的结果与手动实现的FFT结果非常接近，证明我们的FFT函数是正确和有效的。

```shell
[-0.        +0.j        2.41421356+0.7653669j -0.        -0.7653669j
  4.24264069+0.j       2.41421356-0.7653669j -0.        +0.7653669j
 -4.24264069+0.j      -2.41421356+0.7653669j]
```
