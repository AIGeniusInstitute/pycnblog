### 4.5 举例说明

Let's consider an example to illustrate the application of these mathematical models in image optimization for cloud gaming.

#### Example: Image Resizing Using Bicubic Interpolation

Suppose we have an input image of size \( 640 \times 480 \) and we want to resize it to \( 320 \times 240 \) using bicubic interpolation.

1. **Bicubic Interpolation**:
   We apply bicubic interpolation to the input image to generate the resized image. The bicubic interpolation equation is:
   $$I_{new}(x,y) = \frac{(1-x)^3I(x,y) + 3(1-x)^2xI(x+1,y) + 3(1-x)x^2I(x+2,y) + x^3I(x+3,y)}{((1-x)^3 + 3(1-x)^2x + 3(1-x)x^2 + x^3)}$$
   
2. **Implementation**:
   We implement the bicubic interpolation algorithm in code to resize the input image. The resulting resized image is of higher quality compared to linear interpolation methods like bilinear interpolation.

#### Example: Image Compression Using JPEG

Suppose we have an input image of size \( 640 \times 480 \) and we want to compress it using JPEG compression.

1. **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**:
   We apply the DCT to the input image to convert it from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. The DCT equation is:
   $$C(u,v) = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \sum_{y=0}^{N-1} I(x,y) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2x+1}{2N}\pi \cdot u\right) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2y+1}{2N}\pi \cdot v\right)$$
   
2. **Quantization**:
   We apply quantization to the DCT coefficients to reduce the image size. The quantization process involves dividing the DCT coefficients by a quantization matrix and rounding the result to the nearest integer.

3. **Implementation**:
   We implement the JPEG compression algorithm in code to compress the input image. The resulting compressed image is smaller in size but retains a significant portion of the original image quality.

#### Example: Image Filtering Using Spatial Filtering

Suppose we have an input image of size \( 640 \times 480 \) and we want to apply a spatial filtering technique like median filtering to remove noise.

1. **Median Filtering**:
   We apply median filtering to the input image using a \( 3 \times 3 \) kernel. The median filtering equation is:
   $$O(x,y) = \text{median}\{I(x-i,y-j) | i \in [-1, 1], j \in [-1, 1]\}$$
   
2. **Implementation**:
   We implement the median filtering algorithm in code to remove noise from the input image. The resulting filtered image has reduced noise and retains the essential features of the original image.

#### Example: Image Reconstruction Using Inverse DCT

Suppose we have a compressed image using JPEG compression and we want to reconstruct the original image using the inverse DCT.

1. **Inverse DCT**:
   We apply the inverse DCT to the compressed image to convert it from the frequency domain back to the spatial domain. The inverse DCT equation is:
   $$I(x,y) = \frac{1}{4N} \sum_{u=0}^{N-1} \sum_{v=0}^{N-1} C(u,v) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2u+1}{2N}\pi \cdot x\right) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{2v+1}{2N}\pi \cdot y\right)$$
   
2. **Implementation**:
   We implement the inverse DCT algorithm in code to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image. The resulting reconstructed image is of similar quality to the original image.
