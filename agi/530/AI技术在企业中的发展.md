### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin key algorithms in AI, providing a detailed explanation and examples to enhance understanding. We will cover linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks, focusing on their mathematical foundations and how they are applied in practice.

#### 1. Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X). The simplest form is the linear model, which assumes a linear relationship between Y and X:

\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X \]

Where \(\beta_0\) is the intercept and \(\beta_1\) is the slope of the line. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points to make predictions.

**Mathematical Model:**

Given a dataset \((X_i, Y_i)\), the linear regression model aims to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE):

\[ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i))^2 \]

This can be expressed in matrix form as:

\[ \min \sum_{i=1}^{n} \|(Y - X\beta)\|_2^2 \]

Where \(Y\) is the vector of observed values, \(X\) is the design matrix, and \(\beta\) is the vector of coefficients.

**Gradient Descent Optimization:**

To find the optimal coefficients, we use gradient descent, which involves iteratively updating the coefficients in the direction of the negative gradient:

\[ \beta_{t+1} = \beta_t - \alpha \nabla_\beta J(\beta_t) \]

Where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate and \(J(\beta)\) is the cost function.

#### Example:

Consider a simple dataset with two features and a target variable:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline X & Y \\ \hline 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 4 \\ 3 & 6 \\ \hline \end{array} \]

We want to predict Y given X using linear regression. The design matrix is:

\[ X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

And the target vector is:

\[ Y = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix} \]

The cost function is:

\[ J(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1X_i))^2 \]

To optimize the model, we use gradient descent to update the coefficients iteratively:

\[ \beta_{t+1} = \beta_t - \alpha \nabla_\beta J(\beta_t) \]

After several iterations, we obtain the optimal coefficients:

\[ \beta_0 = 1, \beta_1 = 1 \]

Thus, the linear regression model is:

\[ Y = 1 + 1X \]

#### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of an event occurring. It extends the linear regression model by applying the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to the output:

\[ P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)}} \]

Where \(P(Y=1)\) is the probability of the event occurring. The goal is to find the coefficients \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

**Mathematical Model:**

The likelihood function for logistic regression is given by:

\[ L(\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(Y_i=1)^{y_i} (1 - P(Y_i=1))^{1 - y_i} \]

Where \(y_i\) is the binary target variable (0 or 1). The log-likelihood function is:

\[ \ell(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log(P(Y_i=1)) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - P(Y_i=1)) \]

To find the optimal coefficients, we maximize the log-likelihood function using gradient ascent:

\[ \beta_{t+1} = \beta_t + \alpha \nabla_\beta \ell(\beta_t) \]

#### Example:

Suppose we have a binary classification problem with the following dataset:

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline X & Y \\ \hline 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array} \]

The design matrix is:

\[ X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \]

And the target vector is:

\[ Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

The logistic regression model is:

\[ P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)}} \]

We maximize the log-likelihood function to find the optimal coefficients. After several iterations of gradient ascent, we obtain:

\[ \beta_0 = 0.5, \beta_1 = 1 \]

The logistic regression model is:

\[ P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(0.5 + 1X)}} \]

#### 3. Neural Networks

Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transform data. They are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data through the training process. The core components of a neural network are the input layer, hidden layers, and the output layer.

**Mathematical Model:**

The forward propagation process involves passing input data through the network to generate an output prediction. Each neuron in a layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs, applies an activation function, and passes the result to the next layer.

\[ z = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{a} + b) \]

Where \(z\) is the weighted sum, \(\sigma\) is the activation function, \(\mathbf{W}\) is the weight matrix, \(\mathbf{a}\) is the input vector, and \(b\) is the bias vector.

**Backpropagation Algorithm:**

The backpropagation algorithm is used to train neural networks by updating the weights and biases to minimize the cost function. It involves computing the gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases and using these gradients to update the parameters.

\[ \nabla_\theta J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \nabla_\theta J(\theta)^{(i)} \]

Where \(\theta\) represents the weights and biases, \(m\) is the number of training samples, and \(J(\theta)\) is the cost function.

**Example:**

Consider a simple neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer:

\[ \text{Input Layer: } X \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} \mathbf{a} \]
\[ \text{Hidden Layer: } \mathbf{a} \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} \mathbf{z} \]
\[ \text{Output Layer: } \mathbf{z} \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} \mathbf{y} \]

Where \(X\) is the input, \(\mathbf{a}\) is the activation vector in the hidden layer, \(\mathbf{z}\) is the weighted sum in the hidden layer, and \(\mathbf{y}\) is the output vector.

The cost function is:

\[ J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_k^{(i)} \log(z_k^{(i)}) + (1 - y_k^{(i)}) \log(1 - z_k^{(i)}) \]

After several iterations of forward propagation and backpropagation, the network is trained and can make predictions on new data.

In summary, understanding the mathematical models and formulas of linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks is crucial for developing and optimizing AI algorithms. Through detailed explanations and examples, we can appreciate the underlying principles that drive these powerful techniques.

#### 1. Linear Regression

We start with a simple linear regression example using Python and the scikit-learn library. The goal is to predict housing prices based on the number of rooms and the age of the house.

```python

data = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')
X = data[['rooms', 'age']]
Y = data['price']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set

# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Load the dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255

# Create the neural network model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=64)

# Evaluate the model
