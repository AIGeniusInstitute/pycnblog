### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

#### 数学模型和公式 & 详细讲解 & 举例说明

In the process of enhancing supply capacity through collaboration with new brands and suppliers, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making and resource allocation. This section will provide a detailed explanation of some key mathematical models and formulas, along with practical examples to illustrate their application.

**1. Demand Forecasting Model**

**需求预测模型** is essential for accurately estimating future customer demand. One commonly used model is the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model. The ARIMA model combines autoregression (AR), integration (I), and moving average (MA) components to capture time series patterns and trends.

**ARIMA Model Formula:**

$$
\text{Y}_t = \phi_1 \text{Y}_{t-1} + \phi_2 \text{Y}_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p \text{Y}_{t-p} + \theta_1 \text{e}_{t-1} + \theta_2 \text{e}_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q \text{e}_{t-q}
$$

where:

- $\text{Y}_t$ represents the observed demand at time $t$.
- $\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_p$ are the autoregressive coefficients.
- $\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_q$ are the moving average coefficients.
- $e_t$ is the error term at time $t$.

**Example:**

Suppose we have the following historical demand data for a product over the past 12 months:

$$
\text{Demand}_{1}, \text{Demand}_{2}, ..., \text{Demand}_{12} = 100, 110, 120, 130, 125, 140, 135, 150, 145, 160, 155, 170
$$

We can use the ARIMA model to forecast the demand for the next month.

**2. Inventory Optimization Model**

**库存优化模型** is used to determine the optimal inventory levels and order quantities. One popular approach is the **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** model, which minimizes total inventory costs by balancing ordering and holding costs.

**EOQ Model Formula:**

$$
Q = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H}}
$$

where:

- $Q$ is the optimal order quantity.
- $D$ is the annual demand.
- $S$ is the ordering cost per order.
- $H$ is the holding cost per unit per year.

**Example:**

Assume the annual demand for a product is 10,000 units, the ordering cost is $50 per order, and the holding cost is $2 per unit per year. We can calculate the optimal order quantity using the EOQ model:

$$
Q = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 10,000 \times 50}{2}} = 500
$$

Therefore, the optimal order quantity is 500 units.

**3. Supplier Selection Model**

**供应商选择模型** helps in selecting the most suitable suppliers based on various criteria such as quality, cost, and reliability. One commonly used approach is the **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** model, which incorporates multiple criteria and preferences to rank suppliers.

**MCDA Model Formula:**

$$
S_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_{ij}}
$$

where:

- $S_j$ is the score of supplier $j$.
- $w_i$ is the weight assigned to criterion $i$.
- $x_{ij}$ is the value of criterion $i$ for supplier $j$.

**Example:**

Suppose we have three suppliers with the following scores for quality, cost, and reliability:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Supplier} & \text{Quality} & \text{Cost} & \text{Reliability} \\
\hline
A & 8 & 6 & 7 \\
B & 7 & 7 & 6 \\
C & 9 & 5 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

We can calculate the weighted scores for each supplier using the MCDA model:

$$
S_A = \frac{0.4 \times 8 + 0.3 \times 6 + 0.3 \times 7}{0.4 \times 8 + 0.3 \times 6 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.4 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 6} = 0.578
$$

$$
S_B = \frac{0.4 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 6}{0.4 \times 8 + 0.3 \times 6 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.4 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 6} = 0.527
$$

$$
S_C = \frac{0.4 \times 9 + 0.3 \times 5 + 0.3 \times 8}{0.4 \times 8 + 0.3 \times 6 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.4 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 7 + 0.3 \times 6} = 0.638
$$

Based on the scores, supplier C has the highest overall score and is the most suitable choice.

In conclusion, mathematical models and formulas are essential tools for optimizing decision-making and resource allocation in the process of enhancing supply capacity through collaboration with new brands and suppliers. By applying these models and formulas, e-commerce platforms can make informed decisions and achieve better outcomes.

import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load historical demand data
data = pd.read_csv('historical_demand.csv')
demand = data['demand']

# Split data into training and testing sets
train_data = demand[:n_train]
test_data = demand[n_train:]

# Fit the ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(train_data, order=(p, d, q))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast future demand
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=n_forecast)

# Plot the forecast
plt.plot(train_data, label='Training Data')
plt.plot(test_data, label='Test Data')
plt.plot(np.arange(n_train, n_train + n_forecast), forecast, label='Forecast')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**
- The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading historical demand data from a CSV file.

suppliers = [
    {'quality': 8, 'cost': 6, 'reliability': 7},
    {'quality': 7, 'cost': 7, 'reliability': 6},
    {'quality': 9, 'cost': 5, 'reliability': 8}
]

weights = {'quality': 0.4, 'cost': 0.3, 'reliability': 0.3}

# Calculate supplier scores
scores = []
for supplier in suppliers:
    score = sum(supplier[criterion] * weights[criterion] for criterion in weights)
    scores.append(score / sum(scores))
    
print("Supplier Scores:", scores)
```

**Explanation:**
- The code defines a list of supplier data, including quality, cost, and reliability scores.
- The weights for each criterion are defined as a dictionary.
- The `scores` list is calculated using the MCDA formula, where each supplier's score is the sum of the weighted criteria.
- The average score is calculated to normalize the scores.
- The supplier scores are printed to the console.

In conclusion, this section provided practical examples of implementing demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier selection using Python. The code and explanations helped readers understand the underlying logic and how to apply these algorithms in real-world scenarios.
