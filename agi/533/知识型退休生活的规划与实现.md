### 3.1 Basic Principles of the Core Algorithm for Knowledge-Based Retirement Planning

The core algorithm for knowledge-based retirement planning is designed to help retirees create a scientific, reasonable, and personalized retirement plan. The algorithm is based on the following core principles:

1. **Data-driven**: Collecting and analyzing personal data of retirees, such as health status, interests, and skill levels, to provide data support for the planning.
2. **Goal-oriented**: Clearly defining the retiree's life goals, such as enhancing personal value, maintaining physical and mental health, and making social contributions, to ensure that the plan has a clear direction.
3. **Personalization**: Tailoring the retirement plan to meet the individual characteristics and needs of retirees.
4. **Continuous optimization**: As the retiree's needs change over time, the algorithm should be capable of continuous optimization to ensure that the plan remains in line with their current needs.

### 3.2 Steps of the Core Algorithm for Knowledge-Based Retirement Planning

The core algorithm for knowledge-based retirement planning includes the following specific operational steps:

#### 3.2.1 Data Collection and Organization

1. **Health Data Collection**: Collecting health data from hospitals and health monitoring devices, including blood pressure, blood sugar levels, heart rate, etc.
2. **Interest Survey**: Conducting surveys and interviews to understand retirees' interests, such as travel, reading, painting, music, etc.
3. **Skill Level Assessment**: Evaluating retirees' professional skills and work experience, such as foreign language proficiency, programming ability, management skills, etc.
4. **Data Organization and Classification**: Organizing and categorizing the collected data for subsequent analysis.

#### 3.2.2 Setting Life Goals

1. **Goal Clarification**: Communicating with the retirees to clearly define their life goals, such as enhancing personal value, making social contributions, and maintaining physical and mental health.
2. **Goal Specification**: Breaking down broad goals into specific objectives, such as learning new skills, participating in volunteer activities, maintaining social relationships, etc.
3. **Goal Priority Sorting**: Prioritizing goals based on their importance to ensure that the plan has a clear direction.

#### 3.2.3 Designing a Preliminary Planning Scheme

1. **Planning Scheme Design**: Creating a preliminary retirement plan based on the collected data and life goals.
2. **Scheme Assessment**: Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of the preliminary plan.
3. **Scheme Adjustment**: Optimizing and adjusting the preliminary plan based on the assessment results.

#### 3.2.4 Implementing the Planning Scheme

1. **Execution Plan**: Developing specific execution plans, including learning plans, activity arrangements, and time allocation.
2. **Monitoring Execution**: Monitoring the execution of the plan to ensure that tasks are completed on schedule.
3. **Feedback and Adjustment**: Adjusting the planning scheme based on feedback during the execution process to ensure that it remains in line with the retiree's actual needs.

#### 3.2.5 Continuous Optimization and Feedback

1. **Regular Assessment**: Periodically assessing the retiree's living conditions to understand the effectiveness of the plan.
2. **Optimization and Adjustment**: Optimizing and adjusting the planning scheme based on the assessment results to ensure that it remains in line with the retiree's needs and expectations.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Establishing a feedback mechanism to encourage retirees to provide suggestions and opinions for continuous improvement of the planning scheme.

### 3.3 Code Implementation of the Core Algorithm for Knowledge-Based Retirement Planning

The following is a simple example of Python code implementation for the core algorithm of knowledge-based retirement planning:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Data Collection and Organization
health_data = pd.read_csv('health_data.csv')
interest_survey = pd.read_csv('interest_survey.csv')
skill_evaluation = pd.read_csv('skill_evaluation.csv')

# Setting Life Goals
life_goals = {
    'Enhance Personal Value': True,
