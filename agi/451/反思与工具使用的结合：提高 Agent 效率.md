$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 $$

After training with historical data, the model parameters are estimated to be $\beta_0 = 100, \beta_1 = 2, \beta_2 = 1$. To predict the price of a new house with an area of 100 square meters and an age of 5 years, we substitute these values into the model:
$$ y = 100 + 2 \times 100 + 1 \times 5 = 315 $$

Thus, the predicted price for the new house is 315 million yuan.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**1. Library Importations**

These lines import the necessary libraries for our project:
- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble` for building the Random Forest model.
- `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `mean_squared_error` from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the model's performance.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.

**2. Loading and Preprocessing the Data**

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')

# Preprocess the data
# For simplicity, we will not perform extensive feature engineering here.
# We will just fill missing values and drop irrelevant columns.
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)
data.drop(['id', 'date'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```

**2.1 Loading the Dataset**

The `read_csv` function from pandas is used to load the house prices dataset from a CSV file. This dataset typically contains various features related to houses and their corresponding prices.

**2.2 Preprocessing the Data**

- **Filling Missing Values**: We use the `fillna` method to replace missing values with the mean of the respective columns. This is a simple strategy to handle missing data, assuming that the missing values are not informative.
- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: We drop the 'id' and 'date' columns, which are not relevant for our prediction task.

**3. Splitting the Data**

```python
# Split the data into features and target
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
y = data['price']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**3.1 Splitting the Data**

- `X` represents the feature matrix, containing all the input features except the target variable 'price'.
- `y` is the target vector, containing the actual house prices.
- `train_test_split` is used to split the data into 80% training data and 20% testing data. The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility.

**4. Building and Training the Model**

```python
# Create the Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**4.1 Creating the Model**

We create a `RandomForestRegressor` with 100 trees (`n_estimators=100`). The `random_state` ensures that the model's initialization is consistent.

**4.2 Training the Model**

The `fit` method trains the model using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

**5. Evaluating the Model**

```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

**5.1 Making Predictions**

The `predict` method is used to generate predictions for the test set (`X_test`).

**5.2 Evaluating the Model**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: We calculate the MSE between the predicted prices (`y_pred`) and the actual prices (`y_test`). A lower MSE indicates better model performance.

**6. Visualizing the Results**

```python
# Plot the actual vs. predicted prices
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.title('Actual vs. Predicted House Prices')
plt.show()
```

**6.1 Visualizing the Results**

A scatter plot is used to visualize the actual vs. predicted house prices. Points that fall close to the 45-degree line (y=x) indicate accurate predictions, while those further away suggest potential overfitting or underfitting.
