## 4. 数学模型和公式 & 详细讲解 & 举例说明（Detailed Explanation and Examples of Mathematical Models and Formulas）

### 4.1 Control Theory and PID Control

Control theory is a fundamental aspect of automation, and one of the most commonly used control algorithms is the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. PID control is based on the following mathematical model:

$$
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

where:
- \( u(t) \) is the control signal at time \( t \),
- \( e(t) \) is the error signal at time \( t \) (desired value minus actual value),
- \( K_p \) is the proportional gain,
- \( K_i \) is the integral gain, and
- \( K_d \) is the derivative gain.

### 4.2 Optimization Algorithms

Optimization algorithms are used to find the optimal solution to a problem within a set of constraints. One of the most commonly used optimization algorithms is the Gradient Descent algorithm, which is based on the following mathematical model:

$$
x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{old}} - \alpha \nabla f(x_{\text{old}})
$$

where:
- \( x_{\text{new}} \) is the new value of the variable,
- \( x_{\text{old}} \) is the current value of the variable,
- \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, and
- \( \nabla f(x_{\text{old}}) \) is the gradient of the function \( f \) at \( x_{\text{old}} \).

### 4.3 Example: PID Control in a Heating System

Consider a heating system that needs to maintain a constant temperature. The desired temperature is 70°C, and the current temperature is measured using a temperature sensor.

1. **Define the Error**: The error \( e(t) \) is the difference between the desired temperature and the current temperature.

$$
e(t) = T_{\text{desired}} - T_{\text{current}}
$$

2. **Implement PID Control**: The PID controller is designed to adjust the control signal \( u(t) \) based on the error \( e(t) \). The control signal \( u(t) \) is used to adjust the heating element to maintain the desired temperature.

3. **Measure and Update**: The temperature sensor measures the current temperature, and the PID controller calculates the error \( e(t) \). It then updates the control signal \( u(t) \) based on the PID formula.

4. **Adjust the Heating Element**: The control signal \( u(t) \) is used to adjust the heating element. If the error is positive, the heating element is turned up. If the error is negative, the heating element is turned down.

### 4.4 Example: Gradient Descent in Robot Path Planning

Consider a robot moving in a two-dimensional space and trying to reach a target point from its current position. The goal is to find the optimal path with the minimum distance.

1. **Define the Cost Function**: The cost function \( f(x, y) \) represents the distance between the robot's current position \( (x, y) \) and the target point \( (x_{\text{target}}, y_{\text{target}}) \).

$$
f(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - x_{\text{target}})^2 + (y - y_{\text{target}})^2}
$$

2. **Initialize Parameters**: The robot initializes its position \( (x, y) \) and the learning rate \( \alpha \).

3. **Update Position**: The robot updates its position using the Gradient Descent formula.

$$
x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{old}} - \alpha \nabla f(x_{\text{old}})
$$

$$
y_{\text{new}} = y_{\text{old}} - \alpha \nabla f(y_{\text{old}})
$$

4. **Repeat Until Convergence**: The robot continues updating its position until it reaches the target point or the change in position is below a specified threshold.
