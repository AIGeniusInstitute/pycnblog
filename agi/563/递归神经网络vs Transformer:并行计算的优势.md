## 1. Background Introduction

Neural networks have been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence research for several decades. Over the years, numerous neural network architectures have been proposed, each designed to address specific types of problems. Among them, Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers have emerged as powerful tools for modeling sequential data and achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.

### 1.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data by utilizing recurrent connections. These connections allow the network to retain information from previous inputs, enabling it to capture temporal dependencies in the data. RNNs have been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language modeling, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.

The core idea behind RNNs is to maintain a hidden state vector that captures the information at each time step. At each step, the network takes the current input and the hidden state as inputs, produces an updated hidden state, and passes it to the next time step. The updated hidden state is then used to generate the output for the current time step. This process continues recursively until the sequence is complete.

### 1.2 Transformers

Transformers, proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017, are a revolutionary architecture designed to handle parallel data processing. Unlike RNNs, which process data sequentially, Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between different parts of the input sequence. This allows them to process data in parallel, significantly improving computational efficiency.

The core building block of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which allows each word in the input sequence to weigh the influence of other words differently based on their relevance. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and generate more accurate outputs.

### 1.3 Comparison and Advantages of Parallel Computation

While both RNNs and Transformers have their advantages, the parallel computation capability of Transformers stands out as a significant advantage in many applications. By processing data in parallel, Transformers can achieve faster training and inference times, making them more efficient for large-scale tasks.

Furthermore, parallel computation in Transformers allows for better utilization of modern hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, which have become essential in deep learning. This leads to improved scalability and performance, enabling the training of larger models and handling more complex data.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the core concepts, mathematical models, and practical applications of RNNs and Transformers, highlighting the advantages of parallel computation in Transformers.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

To fully understand the advantages of parallel computation in Transformers, we first need to explore the core concepts and architectural differences between Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers.

### 2.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are based on the idea of recurrent connections, which allow the network to retain information from previous inputs. The core concept of RNNs can be illustrated using a Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
A1[Input 1] --> B1[Hidden State 1]
B1 --> A2[Input 2]
B1 --> C1[Output 1]
C1 --> A3[Input 3]
...
```

In this example, each input is processed along with the previous hidden state to produce an output. The updated hidden state is then passed as input to the next time step. This process continues recursively until the sequence is complete.

The core advantage of RNNs is their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. However, this architecture suffers from several limitations, such as vanishing and exploding gradients, which can lead to difficulties in training deep RNNs.

### 2.2 Transformers

Transformers, on the other hand, are based on the concept of self-attention mechanisms. The core architecture of a Transformer can be illustrated using the following Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
A1[Input Word 1] --> B1[Embedding 1]
B1 --> C1[Positional Encoding 1]
C1 --> D1[Self-Attention 1]
D1 --> E1[Feed Forward 1]
E1 --> F1[Output 1]

A2[Input Word 2] --> B2[Embedding 2]
B2 --> C2[Positional Encoding 2]
C2 --> D2[Self-Attention 2]
D2 --> E2[Feed Forward 2]
E2 --> F2[Output 2]

...
```

In this architecture, each word in the input sequence is first embedded and then combined with positional encodings to provide information about the word's position in the sequence. The self-attention mechanism allows each word to weigh the influence of other words differently based on their relevance, capturing long-range dependencies. Finally, the feed forward layer processes the output of the self-attention mechanism to produce the final output.

The key advantage of Transformers is their ability to process data in parallel, thanks to the self-attention mechanism. This enables faster training and inference times compared to RNNs.

### 2.3 Core Concepts and Connections

The core concepts of RNNs and Transformers can be summarized as follows:

- **Recurrent Connections**: RNNs use recurrent connections to retain information from previous inputs, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between different parts of the input sequence, enabling parallel computation and faster training.
- **Temporal Dependencies**: RNNs excel at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, while Transformers are better suited for capturing long-range dependencies.

In summary, RNNs and Transformers are both powerful neural network architectures with distinct advantages and limitations. RNNs are well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data but suffer from training difficulties due to vanishing and exploding gradients. Transformers, on the other hand, excel at capturing long-range dependencies and enable parallel computation, leading to faster training and inference times. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models and practical applications of these architectures to further highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

### 2. Core Concepts and Connections
#### 2.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data by utilizing recurrent connections. The fundamental principle of RNNs is to maintain a hidden state that encapsulates the information from previous inputs. This hidden state is then used to generate the output for the current input. A Mermaid flowchart can help illustrate this concept:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Input] --> B[Hidden State]
B --> C[Output]
C --> D[Next Input]
D --> B
```

In this flowchart, the hidden state \( h_t \) at time step \( t \) is calculated using the current input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \). The relationship can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h)
$$

where \( \sigma \) is the activation function, \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are weight matrices, and \( b_h \) is the bias vector.

RNNs are particularly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, such as time series, audio, and text. However, they suffer from several drawbacks, including:

- **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**: Due to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, RNNs can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, making it difficult to train deep networks effectively.
- **Slow Computation**: RNNs process data sequentially, leading to slow computation times, especially for long sequences.

#### 2.2 Transformers

Transformers, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, represent a significant breakthrough in the field of neural network architectures. Unlike RNNs, which process data sequentially, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to process data in parallel. This allows them to capture dependencies across the entire input sequence more efficiently.

The core components of a Transformer can be visualized using a Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Input] --> B[Embedding]
B --> C[Positional Encoding]
C --> D[Self-Attention]
D --> E[Feed Forward]
E --> F[Output]

A --> G[Self-Attention]
G --> H[Feed Forward]
H --> I[Output]
```

In this architecture, the input sequence is first embedded and then combined with positional encodings to maintain information about the word's position. The self-attention mechanism allows each word in the input sequence to weigh the influence of other words differently based on their relevance. This process is repeated multiple times in a stack of identical layers to capture long-range dependencies. Mathematically, the self-attention mechanism can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \) are query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.

Transformers offer several advantages over RNNs:

- **Parallel Computation**: By processing data in parallel, Transformers significantly reduce computation time and enable efficient training of large-scale models.
- **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies**: The self-attention mechanism allows Transformers to capture long-range dependencies across the entire input sequence.
- **Scalability**: Transformers can handle longer sequences more efficiently than RNNs, making them suitable for tasks involving large-scale data.

#### 2.3 Core Concepts and Connections

In summary, the core concepts and connections between RNNs and Transformers can be highlighted as follows:

- **Recurrent Connections**: RNNs use recurrent connections to maintain a hidden state that captures information from previous inputs.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Transformers employ a self-attention mechanism to process data in parallel and capture dependencies across the entire input sequence.
- **Temporal Dependencies**: RNNs excel at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, while Transformers are better suited for capturing long-range dependencies.

Understanding these core concepts and their connections helps elucidate the advantages and limitations of each architecture, paving the way for a deeper exploration of their mathematical models and practical applications in the following sections.

### 3. Core Algorithm Principles & Specific Operational Steps

To delve deeper into the core algorithm principles of Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, let's first understand their fundamental operational steps and how they handle data processing.

#### 3.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

The core principle of RNNs revolves around maintaining a hidden state vector that captures the information from previous inputs. At each time step, the RNN takes the current input and the hidden state as inputs and generates an output and an updated hidden state. This process continues recursively until the sequence is complete.

Here are the specific operational steps of RNNs:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the hidden state \( h_0 \) and the input sequence \( x \).
2. **Forward Pass**: For each time step \( t \), perform the following operations:
    - Compute the input-to-hidden weight matrix \( W_h \) and the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix \( W_x \).
    - Compute the hidden state \( h_t \) using the formula:
    \[
    h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h)
    \]
    where \( \sigma \) is the activation function, typically a sigmoid or tanh function.
    - Compute the output \( y_t \) using another weight matrix \( W_y \) and the hidden state:
    \[
    y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
    \]

#### 3.2 Transformers

Transformers operate on the principle of self-attention mechanisms, allowing them to process data in parallel. The core components of a Transformer include embeddings, positional encodings, and multiple layers of self-attention and feed forward networks.

Here are the specific operational steps of Transformers:

1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert the input sequence \( x \) into a series of embeddings \( E \), typically using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
2. **Positional Encodings**: Add positional encodings \( P \) to the input embeddings to maintain information about the word's position in the sequence. This is crucial for capturing the order of words.
3. **Normalization and Scaling**: Apply layer normalization and scaling to the input embeddings and positional encodings to stabilize the learning process and prevent vanishing gradients.
4. **Multiple Layers**: Pass the processed input through multiple layers of self-attention and feed forward networks. Each layer consists of:
    - **Self-Attention Layer**: Compute the self-attention weights using the scaled inputs and apply the self-attention mechanism to generate the output.
    - **Feed Forward Layer**: Apply a feed forward network to the output of the self-attention layer, typically with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation function.
5. **Final Output**: After passing through all the layers, the final output is obtained, which can be used for various tasks like classification, regression, or sequence generation.

#### 3.3 Comparison and Advantages

The operational steps of RNNs and Transformers highlight their key differences:

- **Sequential Processing**: RNNs process data sequentially, one input at a time, while Transformers process data in parallel using self-attention mechanisms.
- **Hidden State**: RNNs maintain a hidden state that captures the information from previous inputs, while Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies across the entire input sequence.
- **Layer Complexity**: Transformers typically have multiple layers of self-attention and feed forward networks, allowing for better capture of dependencies and improved performance on complex tasks.

The advantages of Transformers over RNNs are evident in their ability to process data in parallel and capture long-range dependencies more efficiently. This leads to faster training and inference times, making Transformers well-suited for large-scale tasks in natural language processing and other domains.

In the next section, we will delve into the mathematical models and detailed explanations of RNNs and Transformers to further understand their workings and applications.

### 3. Core Algorithm Principles & Specific Operational Steps

In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the core algorithm principles and operational steps of Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, we will delve into their fundamental architectures and how they process data.

#### 3.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state vector that retains information from previous inputs. This allows the network to capture temporal dependencies in the data. The core architecture of RNNs can be visualized using the following Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Input 1] --> B[Hidden State 1]
B --> C[Output 1]
C --> D[Input 2]
D --> B
B --> E[Output 2]
...
```

In this diagram, the hidden state \( h_t \) at time step \( t \) is calculated based on the current input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \). This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h)
$$

where \( \sigma \) represents the activation function (commonly a sigmoid or tanh function), \( W_h \) and \( W_x \) are weight matrices, and \( b_h \) is the bias vector.

The operational steps of an RNN can be outlined as follows:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the hidden state \( h_0 \) and the input sequence \( x \).
2. **Forward Pass**: For each time step \( t \), perform the following operations:
   - Compute the hidden state \( h_t \) using the above formula.
   - Compute the output \( y_t \) using another weight matrix \( W_y \) and the hidden state:
   \[
   y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
   \]

3. **Backpropagation**: Perform backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update the weights \( W_h \), \( W_x \), and \( W_y \) based on the output error.

The core advantage of RNNs is their ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them particularly suitable for tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and time series analysis. However, RNNs suffer from several challenges, including the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, which can hinder their training effectiveness.

#### 3.2 Transformers

Transformers, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, represent a significant departure from traditional RNN architectures. Instead of processing data sequentially, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to process data in parallel, capturing dependencies across the entire input sequence more efficiently. The core architecture of a Transformer can be visualized using the following Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Input Word 1] --> B[Embedding 1]
B --> C[Positional Encoding 1]
C --> D[Self-Attention 1]
D --> E[Feed Forward 1]
E --> F[Output 1]

A --> G[Self-Attention 2]
G --> H[Feed Forward 2]
H --> I[Output 2]

...
```

In this architecture, each word in the input sequence is first embedded and then combined with positional encodings to provide information about the word's position. The self-attention mechanism allows each word to weigh the influence of other words differently based on their relevance, capturing long-range dependencies. This process is repeated multiple times in a stack of identical layers.

The operational steps of a Transformer can be outlined as follows:

1. **Input Embeddings**: Convert the input sequence \( x \) into a series of embeddings \( E \), typically using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
2. **Positional Encodings**: Add positional encodings \( P \) to the input embeddings to maintain information about the word's position in the sequence.
3. **Normalization and Scaling**: Apply layer normalization and scaling to the input embeddings and positional encodings to stabilize the learning process and prevent vanishing gradients.
4. **Self-Attention Layers**: Pass the processed input through multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms. Each layer computes the self-attention weights using the scaled inputs and applies the self-attention mechanism to generate the output.
5. **Feed Forward Layers**: After passing through the self-attention layers, the output is passed through multiple feed forward layers, typically with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation function.
6. **Final Output**: After passing through all the layers, the final output is obtained, which can be used for various tasks like classification, regression, or sequence generation.

The key advantage of Transformers is their ability to process data in parallel, thanks to the self-attention mechanism. This enables faster training and inference times compared to RNNs, making them well-suited for large-scale tasks in natural language processing and other domains.

In summary, RNNs and Transformers represent two distinct approaches to handling sequential data. RNNs capture temporal dependencies through recurrent connections and suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems. In contrast, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies across the entire input sequence, enabling parallel computation and faster training. In the next section, we will delve into the mathematical models and detailed explanations of RNNs and Transformers to further understand their workings and applications.

### 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. Understanding these models will provide us with a deeper insight into how these architectures process data and generate outputs.

#### 4.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are based on the idea of maintaining a hidden state vector that captures the information from previous inputs. At each time step, the RNN takes the current input and the hidden state as inputs and generates an output and an updated hidden state. The mathematical model for RNNs can be expressed as follows:

1. **Input and Hidden State Representation**

Let \( x_t \) be the input at time step \( t \), \( h_t \) be the hidden state at time step \( t \), and \( y_t \) be the output at time step \( t \). We can represent these variables as vectors:

$$
x_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}, \quad h_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}, \quad y_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_y}
$$

where \( d_x \), \( d_h \), and \( d_y \) are the dimensions of the input, hidden state, and output vectors, respectively.

2. **Recurrent Connection and Hidden State Update**

The hidden state at time step \( t \) is calculated based on the current input and the previous hidden state using the following equation:

$$
h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h)
$$

where \( \sigma \) is an activation function, such as the sigmoid or tanh function. The parameters \( W_h \), \( W_x \), and \( b_h \) are weight matrices and bias vectors, respectively.

3. **Output Generation**

The output at time step \( t \) is generated using the current hidden state and a weight matrix \( W_y \):

$$
y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
$$

where \( b_y \) is the bias vector for the output layer.

#### 4.2 Transformers

Transformers are based on the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to capture dependencies across the entire input sequence in parallel. The mathematical model for Transformers can be expressed as follows:

1. **Embedding and Positional Encoding**

Let \( x_t \) be the input at time step \( t \), \( E_t \) be the embedding at time step \( t \), \( P_t \) be the positional encoding at time step \( t \), and \( h_t \) be the hidden state at time step \( t \). We can represent these variables as vectors:

$$
x_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_x}, \quad E_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_e}, \quad P_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_p}, \quad h_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}
$$

where \( d_x \), \( d_e \), \( d_p \), and \( d_h \) are the dimensions of the input, embedding, positional encoding, and hidden state vectors, respectively.

The input \( x_t \) is first embedded using an embedding matrix \( E \) to obtain \( E_t \):

$$
E_t = E x_t
$$

Positional encodings \( P_t \) are added to the embeddings to maintain information about the word's position in the sequence:

$$
h_t = E_t + P_t
$$

2. **Normalization and Scaling**

To stabilize the learning process and prevent vanishing gradients, we apply layer normalization and scaling to the embeddings and positional encodings:

$$
h_t = \frac{h_t}{\sqrt{d_h}} \odot \text{LayerNorm}(h_t)
$$

where \( \odot \) represents the element-wise multiplication, and \( \text{LayerNorm} \) is the layer normalization function.

3. **Self-Attention Mechanism**

The self-attention mechanism computes the self-attention weights using the scaled hidden states and generates the output as follows:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \) are query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors. These matrices can be derived from the scaled hidden states using weight matrices \( W_Q \), \( W_K \), and \( W_V \):

$$
Q = W_Q h_t, \quad K = W_K h_t, \quad V = W_V h_t
$$

4. **Feed Forward Layers**

After passing through the self-attention mechanism, the output is passed through multiple feed forward layers, typically with two linear transformations and a ReLU activation function:

$$
h_t = \text{ReLU}(W_f h_t + b_f)
$$

where \( W_f \) and \( b_f \) are weight matrices and bias vectors for the feed forward layer.

#### 4.3 Comparison

The mathematical models for RNNs and Transformers highlight their key differences:

- **Recurrent Connections**: RNNs use recurrent connections to maintain a hidden state vector, capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. In contrast, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies across the entire input sequence in parallel.
- **Hidden State Representation**: RNNs represent the hidden state as a vector, while Transformers use a scaled hidden state vector combined with positional encodings.
- **Output Generation**: RNNs generate the output using the current hidden state and a weight matrix, while Transformers use the output of the self-attention mechanism and a feed forward layer.

In summary, the mathematical models of RNNs and Transformers provide a deeper understanding of their architectures and how they process data. While RNNs excel at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, Transformers are better suited for capturing long-range dependencies in parallel, leading to faster training and inference times.

In the next section, we will explore practical examples and applications of these architectures to illustrate their performance and efficiency in real-world scenarios.

### 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical models underlying Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, we will delve into the specific formulas and equations that govern their operations. This section will explain the core mathematical concepts in detail, supported by LaTeX representations for clarity.

#### 4.1 Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed to process sequences of data by maintaining a hidden state vector that captures information from previous inputs. The following are the key mathematical components of an RNN:

**4.1.1 Hidden State Update**

At each time step \( t \), the hidden state \( h_t \) is updated based on the current input \( x_t \) and the previous hidden state \( h_{t-1} \). The update rule can be expressed as:

$$
h_t = \sigma(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t + b_h)
$$

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function, commonly a sigmoid or tanh function.
- \( W_h \) is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden connection.
- \( W_x \) is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden connection.
- \( b_h \) is the bias vector for the hidden layer.

**4.1.2 Output Generation**

The output \( y_t \) is generated using the current hidden state \( h_t \) and a weight matrix \( W_y \):

$$
y_t = W_y h_t + b_y
$$

where:
- \( W_y \) is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-output connection.
- \( b_y \) is the bias vector for the output layer.

**4.1.3 Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**

During the training phase, RNNs use backpropagation through time to update the weights. The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights can be computed using the chain rule:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_h} = \sum_t \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial W_h}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_x} = \sum_t \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_t} \frac{\partial x_t}{\partial W_x}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_h} = \sum_t \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_y} = \sum_t \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_t} \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial h_t}
$$

where:
- \( L \) is the loss function.
- The gradients are computed for each time step and then summed over all time steps.

#### 4.2 Transformers

Transformers are based on the self-attention mechanism, allowing parallel processing of sequences. The following are the key mathematical components of a Transformer:

**4.2.1 Embeddings and Positional Encoding**

The input sequence \( x_t \) is first embedded into a vector \( E_t \):

$$
E_t = E x_t
$$

where \( E \) is the embedding matrix. Positional encodings \( P_t \) are then added to the embeddings to maintain the order information:

$$
h_t = E_t + P_t
$$

**4.2.2 Self-Attention**

The self-attention mechanism is the core component of Transformers. It computes the attention scores between each pair of words in the sequence and combines them to generate the output. The self-attention mechanism can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where:
- \( Q \), \( K \), and \( V \) are the query, key, and value matrices derived from the hidden state \( h_t \) using weight matrices \( W_Q \), \( W_K \), and \( W_V \).
- \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.

**4.2.3 Multi-head Attention**

Transformers use multiple heads of attention to capture different relationships in the data. Each head computes a different attention mechanism and combines them to generate the final output. The multi-head attention can be expressed as:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W_O
$$

where:
- \( \text{head}_i \) is the output of the \( i \)-th attention head.
- \( W_O \) is the output weight matrix.

**4.2.4 Feed Forward Networks**

After the self-attention mechanism, the output is passed through two feed forward networks, each consisting of a linear transformation followed by a ReLU activation function:

$$
h_t = \text{ReLU}(W_f h_t + b_f)
$$

where:
- \( W_f \) and \( b_f \) are the weight matrix and bias vector for the feed forward layer.

**4.2.5 Layer Normalization**

Layer normalization is applied after the self-attention and feed forward layers to stabilize the learning process:

$$
h_t = \frac{h_t - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

where:
- \( \mu \) and \( \sigma \) are the mean and standard deviation of the hidden state \( h_t \).

#### 4.3 Comparison

The mathematical models of RNNs and Transformers highlight their differences:

- **Temporal Processing**: RNNs process data sequentially, using the hidden state to capture temporal dependencies. In contrast, Transformers process data in parallel using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies.
- **Weight Computation**: RNNs require separate weight matrices for each time step, leading to a large number of parameters. Transformers, with their multi-head attention mechanism, share weights across heads, reducing the number of parameters significantly.
- **Gradient Computation**: RNNs suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients during training, which can be mitigated by techniques like gradient clipping and layer normalization. Transformers, with their parallel processing, have more stable gradient computation.

In summary, the mathematical models of RNNs and Transformers provide a foundation for understanding their architectures and operations. While RNNs are effective for capturing temporal dependencies, Transformers excel at capturing global dependencies with parallel processing, leading to more efficient training and inference.

In the next section, we will provide practical examples and applications of these architectures to illustrate their performance and efficiency in real-world scenarios.
