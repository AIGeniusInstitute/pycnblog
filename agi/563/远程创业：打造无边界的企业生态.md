\]
where \(\lambda\) is the arrival rate and \(\mu\) is the service rate.

If \(\lambda = 2\) customers per hour and \(\mu = 3\) customers per hour, the average waiting time is \(\frac{4}{6 - 2} = \frac{2}{3}\) hours or 40 minutes.

### 4.2 Mathematical Models for Remote Collaboration

Remote collaboration involves the use of various mathematical models to optimize communication, collaboration, and teamwork. Some key mathematical models include:

#### 4.2.1 Communication Networks

Communication networks are represented using graph theory. A graph consists of nodes (representing individuals or devices) and edges (representing communication channels). Graph theory provides algorithms for analyzing network structure and optimizing communication flows.

Example:
\[
\text{Shortest path between nodes} = Dijkstra's algorithm
\]

If we have a graph with nodes A, B, C, and D, and edge weights as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Node} & \text{Edge to B} & \text{Edge to C} \\
\hline
A & 5 & 3 \\
B & 0 & 2 \\
C & 1 & 4 \\
D & 2 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\]

The shortest path from A to D is A-B-D with a total weight of 7.

### 4.3 Mathematical Models for Enterprise Ecosystems

Enterprise ecosystems involve the use of various mathematical models to analyze and optimize collaboration, resource sharing, and innovation. Some key mathematical models include:

#### 4.3.1 Network Economics

Network economics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of networks and their economic impact. It involves analyzing the value creation and sharing mechanisms within an ecosystem.

Example:
\[
\text{Value creation} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i
\]
where \(N\) is the number of network participants and \(v_i\) is the value added by participant \(i\).

If there are 5 participants in a network, and their individual value contributions are [10, 15, 20, 25, 30], the total value creation is \(\frac{1}{5} \times (10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30) = 20\).

### 4.4 Detailed Explanation and Examples

#### 4.4.1 Linear Programming Example

Consider a small manufacturing company that produces two products, X and Y. The production process requires two resources, labor (L) and machine time (M). The cost per hour of labor is \$10 and the cost per hour of machine time is \$20. The company wants to maximize its profit while meeting demand.

The profit function is given by:
\[
\text{Maximize} \ P = 20x + 30y - 10L - 20M
\]

The constraints are:
\[
\begin{align*}
x + 2y &\leq 100 \ (\text{labor constraint}) \\
2x + y &\leq 120 \ (\text{machine time constraint}) \\
x, y &\geq 0 \ (\text{non-negativity constraints})
\end{align*}
\]

Solving this linear programming problem using the simplex method, we find that the optimal solution is \(x = 50, y = 25\), with a maximum profit of \$900.

#### 4.4.2 Queuing Theory Example

A call center receives an average of 50 calls per hour. The average handling time per call is 2 minutes. The call center has 5 agents available to handle calls. What is the average waiting time for a caller?

Using the formula for average waiting time in queuing theory:
\[
\text{Average waiting time} = \frac{\lambda^2}{2(\mu - \lambda)}
\]
where \(\lambda = 50\) calls per hour and \(\mu = \frac{5}{60}\) calls per hour (5 agents working 8 hours a day).

\[
\text{Average waiting time} = \frac{50^2}{2\left(\frac{5}{60} - 50\right)} \approx 18.75 \text{ minutes}
\]

#### 4.4.3 Communication Networks Example

Consider a network with 4 nodes (A, B, C, D) and the following communication delays (in milliseconds):

\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Node} & \text{Delay to B} & \text{Delay to C} \\
\hline
A & 10 & 20 \\
B & 30 & 40 \\
C & 50 & 60 \\
D & 70 & 80 \\
\end{array}
\]

To minimize the total delay, we need to find the shortest path from node A to node D. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path is A-B-D with a total delay of 90 milliseconds.

#### 4.4.4 Network Economics Example

In a technology ecosystem, there are 5 companies collaborating on a joint project. Each company contributes different amounts of value to the project. The total value created by the ecosystem is given by:

\[
\text{Value creation} = \frac{1}{5} \sum_{i=1}^{5} v_i
\]

where the individual value contributions are [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]. The total value creation is:

\[
\text{Value creation} = \frac{1}{5} \times (20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60) = 40
\]

## 5. Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

### 5.1 Development Environment Setup

To implement the concepts discussed in this article, we need to set up a development environment that includes the necessary tools and technologies. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up a development environment for remote entrepreneurship.

#### 5.1.1 Choose an Operating System

You can choose an operating system that suits your needs, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. For this example, we will use Linux.

#### 5.1.2 Install Python

Python is a popular programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development. To install Python, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the command `sudo apt-get install python3`.
3. Run the command `python3 --version` to verify the installation.

#### 5.1.3 Install Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing platform that allows you to run code and create visualizations in a web browser. To install Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the command `sudo pip3 install notebook`.
3. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter Notebook server.

#### 5.1.4 Install Virtualenv

Virtualenv is a tool that allows you to create isolated Python environments. This is useful for managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts between projects. To install Virtualenv, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the command `sudo pip3 install virtualenv`.
3. Create a new virtual environment by running `virtualenv myenv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment by running `source myenv/bin/activate`.

### 5.2 Source Code Example

Below is a Python code example that demonstrates the use of linear programming to maximize profit in a manufacturing company.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Objective function coefficients
c = [-20, -30]

# Inequality constraint coefficients
A = [[1, 2], [2, 1]]
b = [100, 120]

# Non-negativity constraints
x0 = [0, 0]

# Solve the linear programming problem
result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, x0=x0, method='highs')

if result.success:
    x = result.x
    profit = np.dot(c, x)
    print(f"Optimal solution: x = {x}, Maximum profit: ${profit:.2f}")
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

### 5.3 Code Explanation

The code above uses the `linprog` function from the `scipy.optimize` module to solve a linear programming problem. The objective function is to maximize profit, represented by the coefficients `c`. The inequality constraints are represented by the matrix `A` and the vector `b`. The non-negativity constraints are represented by the vector `x0`.

The `linprog` function returns a `result` object that contains information about the solution. If the problem is solvable, the solution is stored in the `x` attribute of the `result` object. The maximum profit is calculated by taking the dot product of the objective function coefficients `c` and the solution `x`.

### 5.4 Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Save the code in a file named `remote_entrepreneurship.py`.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run the command `python3 remote_entrepreneurship.py`.

The output should display the optimal solution and the maximum profit.

```
Optimal solution: x = [50. 25], Maximum profit: $900.00
```
