### 2. 核心概念与联系（Core Concepts and Connections）

In order to understand the formalization of cognition, it is essential to delve into the core concepts that have shaped our understanding of the world. These concepts include the development of numerical symbols, the formation of numbers and geometric shapes, and the evolution of written language. Each of these concepts has played a significant role in the development of human civilization and the advancement of technology.

#### 2.1 The Development of Numerical Symbols

The development of numerical symbols is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Numerical symbols, such as the digits 0-9, are used to represent quantities and perform mathematical operations. The origin of these symbols can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where early humans used simple marks and symbols to keep track of numbers and quantities.

One of the earliest known numerical symbols is the "cuneiform" system developed by the Sumerians around 3200 BCE. The Sumerians used a system of wedges to make impressions on clay tablets, creating a series of marks that represented different numbers. This system was later adopted and adapted by other civilizations, such as the Babylonians and the Assyrians.

Another important development in the history of numerical symbols is the decimal system, which was first introduced by the Indians around the 6th century CE. The decimal system uses a base-10 approach, with each digit representing a power of 10. This system was later adopted by the Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans, leading to the widespread use of the decimal system we use today.

The development of numerical symbols has had a profound impact on human cognition. By providing a standardized way to represent and manipulate numbers, numerical symbols have enabled humans to perform complex calculations, develop scientific theories, and advance technology. They have also played a crucial role in the development of computer science, as they form the basis for binary arithmetic and digital computing.

#### 2.2 The Formation of Numbers and Geometric Shapes

Numbers and geometric shapes are fundamental concepts that have shaped our understanding of the world. The concept of numbers originated from the need to count and measure. Early humans used simple counting systems based on their fingers and toes to keep track of objects and quantities. Over time, these systems evolved and became more sophisticated, leading to the development of the decimal system and other numerical notations.

Geometric shapes, on the other hand, have a long and fascinating history. Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and the Greeks, used geometric shapes in their architecture, art, and scientific discoveries. The Egyptians used geometric shapes to design their pyramids and temples, while the Greeks developed sophisticated theories of geometry that laid the foundation for modern mathematics.

The connection between numbers and geometric shapes is evident in various mathematical concepts. For example, the Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. This theorem has been fundamental in the development of geometry and trigonometry, which have found numerous applications in fields such as engineering, physics, and computer science.

#### 2.3 The Evolution of Written Language

The evolution of written language is closely linked to the development of numerical symbols and fundamental concepts. Written language provides a means to record and communicate ideas, concepts, and information. It allows humans to store knowledge for future generations and to build upon the achievements of the past.

The earliest forms of written language were developed by ancient civilizations, such as the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Chinese. The Sumerians used cuneiform script to record their transactions, laws, and religious texts. The Egyptians used hieroglyphs to write down their hieroglyphs, while the Chinese developed a logographic script that used characters to represent words and ideas.

Over time, written language evolved and became more sophisticated. The invention of the alphabet by the Phoenicians around 1800 BCE revolutionized written communication. The alphabet provided a simple and efficient way to represent sounds and words, leading to the development of writing systems that are still used today, such as the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

The evolution of written language has had a significant impact on human cognition. It has enabled humans to record and preserve knowledge, develop scientific theories, and communicate ideas across time and space. It has also played a crucial role in the development of modern technology, as it forms the basis for programming languages and natural language processing algorithms.

### 2.4 The Relationship Between Numerical Symbols, Numbers, and Geometric Shapes

The relationship between numerical symbols, numbers, and geometric shapes is complex and interwoven. Numerical symbols provide a means to represent and manipulate numbers, which are essential for mathematical calculations and problem-solving. Numbers, on the other hand, are used to quantify and measure geometric shapes, enabling the development of geometric theories and applications.

One key relationship between numerical symbols and geometric shapes is the concept of area and volume. In geometry, area represents the amount of space occupied by a two-dimensional shape, while volume represents the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object. The development of numerical symbols and the ability to perform mathematical operations on numbers have enabled humans to calculate and measure these quantities accurately.

For example, the formula for the area of a circle is given by A = πr^2, where A represents the area, π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. This formula allows us to calculate the area of a circle based on its radius, using numerical symbols and mathematical operations.

Similarly, the concept of volume is essential in various fields, such as engineering and physics. The formula for the volume of a cube is given by V = s^3, where V represents the volume and s is the length of a side of the cube. This formula allows us to calculate the volume of a cube based on its side length, using numerical symbols and mathematical operations.

The relationship between numerical symbols, numbers, and geometric shapes is not limited to area and volume calculations. It extends to various other geometric concepts, such as perimeter, circumference, and angle measurement. The development of these concepts has enabled humans to design and construct structures, develop engineering solutions, and advance technology.

In conclusion, the formalization of cognition involves the development of numerical symbols, the formation of numbers and geometric shapes, and the evolution of written language. These core concepts have shaped our understanding of the world and have been instrumental in the advancement of technology and science. By examining the historical and theoretical aspects of these concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the formalization of cognition and its implications for human civilization.

### 3. 核心算法原理 & 具体操作步骤（Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps）

The core algorithm principles and specific operational steps in the formalization of cognition involve the representation and manipulation of numerical symbols and geometric shapes. This section will explore the basic principles of these algorithms and provide a step-by-step explanation of their implementation.

#### 3.1 Representation of Numerical Symbols

The representation of numerical symbols is a fundamental aspect of the formalization of cognition. One common approach to representing numerical symbols is using binary digits, or bits, to encode each digit. The binary system uses a base-2 approach, with each digit representing a power of 2.

**Algorithm: Encoding Decimal Numbers to Binary**

1. **Input**: A decimal number (e.g., 42)
2. **Output**: A binary string (e.g., 101010)

**Steps:**

1. Initialize an empty binary string.
2. Divide the decimal number by 2 and obtain the remainder.
3. Add the remainder to the binary string.
4. Update the decimal number to be the integer quotient obtained from the division.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the decimal number becomes 0.
6. Reverse the binary string.

**Example:**

Let's encode the decimal number 42 to binary:

1. 42 ÷ 2 = 21, remainder 0 (add 0 to binary string)
2. 21 ÷ 2 = 10, remainder 1 (add 1 to binary string)
3. 10 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 0 (add 0 to binary string)
4. 5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1 (add 1 to binary string)
5. 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0 (add 0 to binary string)
6. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1 (add 1 to binary string)

Reversing the binary string, we get: 101010

#### 3.2 Representation of Geometric Shapes

Representing geometric shapes in a computational system involves defining the shape's properties, such as its dimensions, angles, and coordinates. One common approach is using vector graphics, where shapes are represented as collections of lines and curves.

**Algorithm: Representing a Circle Using Parametric Equations**

1. **Input**: The center point (x_c, y_c), radius (r), and an angle (θ)
2. **Output**: The parametric equations for the circle

**Steps:**

1. Define the parametric equations for the circle:
   x = x_c + r * cos(θ)
   y = y_c + r * sin(θ)

2. Iterate through a range of angles (e.g., 0 to 2π) to generate points on the circle.

**Example:**

Consider a circle with a center point at (0, 0), a radius of 5, and an angle of π/4.

1. x = 0 + 5 * cos(π/4) = 5 * √2/2
2. y = 0 + 5 * sin(π/4) = 5 * √2/2

The point on the circle at an angle of π/4 is (5 * √2/2, 5 * √2/2).

#### 3.3 Manipulation of Numerical Symbols and Geometric Shapes

Manipulating numerical symbols and geometric shapes involves performing mathematical operations and transformations. These operations are essential for various applications, such as computational geometry, computer graphics, and simulations.

**Algorithm: Scaling a Geometric Shape**

1. **Input**: A geometric shape (e.g., a circle) and a scaling factor (s)
2. **Output**: The scaled geometric shape

**Steps:**

1. For each point (x, y) in the shape:
   a. Calculate the new coordinates by multiplying the original coordinates by the scaling factor:
      x' = x * s
      y' = y * s
   b. Update the shape with the new coordinates.

**Example:**

Consider a circle with a center point at (0, 0), a radius of 5, and a scaling factor of 2.

1. Scale the x-coordinate: x' = 0 * 2 = 0
2. Scale the y-coordinate: y' = 0 * 2 = 0

The scaled circle has a new center point at (0, 0) and a radius of 10.

#### 3.4 Application of Core Algorithms

The core algorithms for representing and manipulating numerical symbols and geometric shapes have various applications in computer science and technology. For example:

1. **Computer Graphics**: Algorithms for rendering and manipulating 2D and 3D shapes are used in video games, animation, and virtual reality.

### 4. 数学模型和公式 & 详细讲解 & 举例说明（Detailed Explanation and Examples of Mathematical Models and Formulas）

In the formalization of cognition, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in representing and manipulating numerical symbols and geometric shapes. This section will provide a detailed explanation of some key mathematical models and formulas, along with examples to illustrate their applications.

#### 4.1 The Decimal Number System

The decimal number system is the most widely used numerical system in modern mathematics. It is based on the concept of place value, where each digit represents a specific power of 10. The decimal number system uses ten digits (0-9) to represent all numbers.

**Formula: Converting a Decimal Number to Binary**

The formula for converting a decimal number to binary involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and recording the remainders. The binary representation is obtained by reversing the sequence of remainders.

**Example:**

Convert the decimal number 42 to binary.

1. 42 ÷ 2 = 21, remainder 0
2. 21 ÷ 2 = 10, remainder 1
3. 10 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 0
4. 5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1
5. 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
6. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

Reversing the remainders, we get the binary representation: 101010

#### 4.2 The Binary Number System

The binary number system is a base-2 numerical system used in computer science and digital electronics. It uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers.

**Formula: Converting a Binary Number to Decimal**

The formula for converting a binary number to decimal involves multiplying each digit by the corresponding power of 2 and summing the results.

**Example:**

Convert the binary number 101010 to decimal.

1. 1 * 2^5 = 32
2. 0 * 2^4 = 0
3. 1 * 2^3 = 8
4. 0 * 2^2 = 0
5. 1 * 2^1 = 2
6. 0 * 2^0 = 0

Summing the results, we get the decimal representation: 42

#### 4.3 The Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental geometric formula that relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

**Formula: Pythagorean Theorem**

c^2 = a^2 + b^2

where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.

**Example:**

Consider a right-angled triangle with side lengths a = 3, b = 4. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.

1. a^2 = 3^2 = 9
2. b^2 = 4^2 = 16
3. c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 9 + 16 = 25
4. c = √25 = 5

The length of the hypotenuse is 5 units.

#### 4.4 The Circle Area Formula

The area of a circle is a measure of the amount of space enclosed by the circle. The formula for calculating the area of a circle involves using the radius and the mathematical constant π (pi).

**Formula: Circle Area**

A = πr^2

where A is the area of the circle and r is the radius.

**Example:**

Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units.

1. r^2 = 5^2 = 25
2. A = π * 25 = 25π ≈ 78.54

The area of the circle is approximately 78.54 square units.

#### 4.5 The Triangle Area Formula

The area of a triangle can be calculated using various formulas, depending on the information available. One common formula is Heron's formula, which uses the lengths of the triangle's sides.

**Heron's Formula:**

A = √(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where A is the area of the triangle, s is the semi-perimeter (s = (a + b + c) / 2), and a, b, and c are the lengths of the triangle's sides.

**Example:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with side lengths a = 5, b = 6, and c = 7.

1. s = (5 + 6 + 7) / 2 = 9
2. A = √(9 * (9 - 5) * (9 - 6) * (9 - 7)) = √(9 * 4 * 3 * 2) = √(216) ≈ 14.7

The area of the triangle is approximately 14.7 square units.

In conclusion, mathematical models and formulas are essential tools in the formalization of cognition. They provide a means to represent and manipulate numerical symbols and geometric shapes, enabling the development of innovative solutions and advancements in computer science and technology.
