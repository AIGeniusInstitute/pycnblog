$$

其中，$y$ 表示样本的真实标签，$\hat{y}$ 表示模型预测的概率。

### 4.2 梯度下降（Gradient Descent）

梯度下降是一种用于优化模型参数的迭代算法。其基本思想是沿着损失函数的梯度方向更新模型参数，以减小损失函数的值。梯度下降分为批量梯度下降、随机梯度下降和Adam优化器等不同类型。

#### 4.2.1 批量梯度下降（Batch Gradient Descent）

批量梯度下降（BGD）是一种在每次迭代过程中使用整个训练集来计算梯度的方法。其更新公式如下：

$$

$$

其中，$\theta_j$ 表示第 $j$ 个模型参数，$J$ 表示损失函数，$\alpha$ 表示学习率。

#### 4.2.2 随机梯度下降（Stochastic Gradient Descent, SGD）

随机梯度下降（SGD）是一种在每次迭代过程中随机选择一个样本来计算梯度的方法。其更新公式如下：

$$
\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

其中，$x_i$ 和 $y_i$ 分别表示第 $i$ 个样本的特征和标签。

#### 4.2.3 Adam 优化器（Adam Optimizer）

$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$

其中，$y$ 是因变量，$x$ 是自变量，$\theta_0$ 和 $\theta_1$ 分别是模型参数。

#### 4.3.1 数据集

$$

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \theta_0 - \theta_1 \cdot x_i) \cdot x_i
$$

然后，使用梯度下降算法更新模型参数：

$$
\theta_0 = \theta_0 - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0}
$$

$$
\theta_1 = \theta_1 - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1}
$$

通过多次迭代，模型参数将逐渐收敛到最佳值。最终，我们得到线性回归模型的预测公式：

$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$

这个例子展示了如何使用数学模型和公式来训练一个简单的线性回归模型。在实际应用中，模型可能会更加复杂，涉及多种损失函数和优化算法，但基本原理相同。

### 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

Before introducing the mathematical models and formulas used in Apple's AI applications, it's important to understand some fundamental concepts in machine learning, such as loss functions, gradient descent, and optimization algorithms. These concepts are crucial for comprehending the mathematical models behind AI applications.

#### 4.1 Loss Functions

A loss function is a function that measures the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in machine learning. It is used to guide the optimization process, aiming to make the model's predictions closer to the true values. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Cross-Entropy, and Hinge Loss.

##### 4.1.1 Mean Squared Error (MSE)

MSE is a common loss function that measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Its formula is as follows:

$$
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

where $y_i$ represents the true value of the $i$-th sample, $\hat{y}_i$ represents the predicted value of the $i$-th sample, and $n$ represents the total number of samples.

##### 4.1.2 Cross-Entropy

Cross-Entropy is a loss function commonly used for classification problems. Its formula is as follows:

$$
H(y, \hat{y}) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
$$

where $y$ is a probability distribution representing the true labels, and $\hat{y}$ is the probability distribution output by the model.

##### 4.1.3 Hinge Loss

Hinge Loss is often used in Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks. Its formula is as follows:

$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = \max(0, 1 - y \cdot \hat{y})
$$

where $y$ represents the true label of the sample, and $\hat{y}$ represents the predicted probability.

#### 4.2 Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an iterative algorithm used for optimizing model parameters. The basic idea is to update the model parameters along the direction of the gradient of the loss function, aiming to minimize the loss. Gradient Descent comes in different forms, such as Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and the Adam Optimizer.

##### 4.2.1 Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)

Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) is a method that uses the entire training set to compute the gradients at each iteration. Its update formula is as follows:

$$
\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

where $\theta_j$ represents the $j$-th model parameter, $J$ represents the loss function, and $\alpha$ represents the learning rate.

##### 4.2.2 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a method that uses a single sample to compute the gradients at each iteration. Its update formula is as follows:

$$
\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_j}
$$

where $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the feature and label of the $i$-th sample, respectively.

##### 4.2.3 Adam Optimizer

Adam Optimizer is an improved version of Gradient Descent that combines the advantages of SGD and Momentum. Its update formula is as follows:

$$
\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \cdot \frac{m_j}{1 - \beta_1^t}
$$

where $m_j$ and $v_j$ represent the momentum and variance of the $j$-th sample, respectively, and $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ represent the exponential decay rates for the first and second moments.

#### 4.3 Example Explanation

To better understand the above mathematical models and formulas, let's consider a simple linear regression example.

Suppose we have a simple linear regression model with the following formula:

$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$

where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ is the independent variable, and $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are the model parameters.

##### 4.3.1 Dataset

We have a dataset with the following samples:

| $x$ | $y$ |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | 3   |
| 2   | 5   |
| 3   | 7   |

##### 4.3.2 Model Training

Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) as the optimization algorithm, we train the model. First, we need to compute the gradient of the loss function:

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \theta_0 - \theta_1 \cdot x_i)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \theta_0 - \theta_1 \cdot x_i) \cdot x_i
$$

Then, we use the gradient descent algorithm to update the model parameters:

$$
\theta_0 = \theta_0 - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_0}
$$

$$
\theta_1 = \theta_1 - \alpha \cdot \frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_1}
$$

Through multiple iterations, the model parameters will converge to the optimal values. Finally, we obtain the prediction formula for the linear regression model:

$$
y = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x
$$

This example demonstrates how to use mathematical models and formulas to train a simple linear regression model. In practical applications, models may be more complex, involving various loss functions and optimization algorithms, but the basic principles remain the same.
