# Generate design inspirations
input_image = preprocess_image(image)
predictions = model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_image, axis=0))
predicted_design = decode_predictions(predictions)[0]

# Recommend outfits
def recommend_outfit(design):
    outfits = load_outfits()
    best_fit = None
    max_similarity = 0
    for outfit in outfits:
        similarity = cosine_similarity(design, outfit)
        if similarity > max_similarity:
            best_fit = outfit
            max_similarity = similarity
    return best_fit

best_outfit = recommend_outfit(predicted_design)

\[ \text{CNN} = \frac{\partial \text{损失函数}}{\partial \text{权重}} \]

where:
- **损失函数** measures the difference between the predicted and actual classes.
- **权重** represents the parameters of the CNN that are adjusted during training to minimize the loss function.

Example:

Suppose we have a dataset of images of clothing items. A CNN model might be trained to recognize different types of clothing, such as shirts, pants, and dresses. The model would output a probability distribution over these classes for each input image.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

##### 4.1.2 Pose Estimation Model

Pose estimation is another critical component of AR, where the positions and orientations of objects in the real world are determined. A popular algorithm for this task is the OpenPose framework, which uses deep learning to estimate human poses from images or videos.

The mathematical model for pose estimation involves regression tasks, where the model predicts the 2D or 3D coordinates of body joints.

\[ \text{输出坐标} = f(\text{输入图像}, \text{权重}) \]

Example:

Using the OpenPose framework, we can estimate the pose of a person in an image.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained OpenPose model
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe("PoseNet/deploy.prototxt", "PoseNet/pose_iter_440000.caffemodel")

# Define the input size and mean subtraction values
input_size = (368, 368)
mean_values = (104.00699, 117.97000, 123.68000)

# Process the image
image = cv2.imread("input_image.jpg")
image = cv2.resize(image, input_size)
image = image - np.array(mean_values)

# Pass the image through the network
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 1.0, input_size, mean_values[:3], True)
net.setInput(blob)
outputs = net.forward()

# Extract the pose coordinates
joints = outputs[0, 0, :, :]

# Process the joints to extract positions
positions = []
for part in joints:
    positions.append((part[0], part[1]))

print("Joints positions:", positions)
```

#### 4.2 Mathematical Models and Formulas in Virtual Reality (VR)

##### 4.2.1 Spatial Mapping Model

Spatial mapping involves creating a 3D representation of the real-world environment. One common algorithm for spatial mapping is the Structure from Motion (SfM) method, which reconstructs 3D scenes from multiple images taken from different viewpoints.

The SfM process can be broken down into several steps:

1. **Image Feature Detection**: Detect key features in each image, such as corners and edges.
2. **Feature Matching**: Match corresponding features across images to establish correspondences.
3. ** triangulation**: Triangulate the 3D positions of the matched features using triangulation algorithms.

The mathematical model for SfM can be represented as:

\[ \text{三维坐标} = \text{ triangulation}(\text{匹配特征点}) \]

Example:

Using a library like OpenCV to perform SfM.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Detect features and compute descriptors
features1 = cv2.SIFT_create().detectAndCompute(image1, None)
features2 = cv2.SIFT_create().detectAndCompute(image2, None)

# Match features
matcher = cv2.BFMatcher()
matches = matcher.knnMatch(features1, features2, k=2)

# Select good matches
good_matches = []
for m, n in matches:
    if m.distance < 0.75 * n.distance:
        good_matches.append(m)

# Extract matched points
points1 = np.float32([features1[m.queryIdx].pt for m in good_matches]).reshape(-1, 1, 2)
points2 = np.float32([features2[m.trainIdx].pt for m in good_matches]).reshape(-1, 1, 2)

# Perform triangulation
F, mask = cv2.findFundamentalMat(points1, points2, cv2.FM_LMEDS)
points3D = cv2.triangulatePoints(F, points1, points2)

# Convert points to a more intuitive format
points3D = np.squeeze(points3D)
points3D = points3D / points3D[-1, :]

print("3D points:", points3D)
```

##### 4.2.2 Rendering Model

Rendering in VR involves creating and displaying 3D graphics that appear realistic and immersive. One of the key steps in rendering is shading, which involves calculating the color and intensity of each pixel based on the position of light sources, surface properties, and material characteristics.

The rendering equation is a fundamental formula that describes the shading of a pixel:

\[ L_o(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}) = L_e(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}', \mathbf{w}) L_i(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}') \cos \theta_{iw} d\omega' \]

where:
- \( L_o(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}) \) is the outgoing light (color and intensity) of a pixel at point \(\mathbf{p}\) with direction \(\mathbf{w}\).
- \( L_e(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}) \) is the emitted light from the light source.
- \( f_r(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}', \mathbf{w}) \) is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which describes how light is reflected from a surface.
- \( L_i(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{w}') \) is the incoming light at point \(\mathbf{p}\) with direction \(\mathbf{w}'\).
- \( \theta_{iw} \) is the angle between the incoming light direction \(\mathbf{w}'\) and the surface normal at point \(\mathbf{p}\).

Example:

Using the rendering equation to calculate the color of a pixel in a 3D scene.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the rendering equation parameters
L_e = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])  # Emitted light color
f_r = np.array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])  # BRDF
L_i = np.array([0.8, 0.8, 0.8])  # Incoming light color
theta_iw = np.deg2rad(30)  # Angle between incoming light and surface normal

# Calculate the outgoing light color
L_o = L_e + np.dot(f_r, L_i) * np.cos(theta_iw)

print("Outgoing light color:", L_o)
```

#### 4.3 Mathematical Models and Formulas in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

##### 4.3.1 Fashion Design Generation Model

One application of AI in Virtual Fashion Week is the generation of new fashion designs. This can be achieved using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously.

The generator tries to create realistic fashion designs, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated designs.

The mathematical model for GANs can be represented as:

\[ G(z) \leftarrow \text{Generator}(z) \]
\[ D(x) \leftarrow \text{Discriminator}(x) \]
\[ D(G(z)) \leftarrow \text{Discriminator}(\text{Generator}(z)) \]

where:
- \( G(z) \) generates new fashion designs from random noise \( z \).
- \( D(x) \) distinguishes between real fashion designs \( x \) and generated designs \( G(z) \).

Example:

Using TensorFlow to implement a GAN for fashion design generation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the generator and discriminator
def make_generator_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Dense(7 * 7 * 256, use_bias=False, input_shape=(100,)))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Reshape((7, 7, 256)))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 7, 7, 256)
    
    # Add more layers to create a 64x64 image
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(128, (5, 5), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(64, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Conv2DTranspose(1, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', activation='tanh', use_bias=False))
    assert model.output_shape == (None, 64, 64, 1)
    
    return model

def make_discriminator_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same', input_shape=[64, 64, 1]))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))
    
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(128, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2), padding='same'))
    model.add(layers.LeakyReLU())
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.3))
    
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(1))
    
    return model

# Instantiate the models
generator = make_generator_model()
discriminator = make_discriminator_model()

# Define the loss function
cross_entropy = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

def discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output):
    real_loss = cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(real_output), real_output)
    fake_loss = cross_entropy(tf.zeros_like(fake_output), fake_output)
    total_loss = real_loss + fake_loss
    return total_loss

def generator_loss(fake_output):
    return cross_entropy(tf.ones_like(fake_output), fake_output)

# Define the optimizers
generator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)
discriminator_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(1e-4)

@tf.function
def train_step(images, noise):
    with tf.GradientTape() as gen_tape, tf.GradientTape() as disc_tape:
        generated_images = generator(noise)
        
        # Train the discriminator
        real_output = discriminator(images)
        fake_output = discriminator(generated_images)
        
        gen_loss = generator_loss(fake_output)
        disc_loss = discriminator_loss(real_output, fake_output)
        
        # Update the weights of the generator and discriminator
        gradients_of_generator = gen_tape.gradient(gen_loss, generator.trainable_variables)
        gradients_of_discriminator = disc_tape.gradient(disc_loss, discriminator.trainable_variables)
        
        generator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_generator, generator.trainable_variables))
        discriminator_optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients_of_discriminator, discriminator.trainable_variables))

# Train the models
EPOCHS = 50
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for image_batch, _ in train_dataset:
        noise = tf.random.normal([image_batch.shape[0], 100])
        train_step(image_batch, noise)
```

##### 4.3.2 Fashion Recommendation Model

AI can also be used to provide personalized fashion recommendations to users. This can be achieved using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

Collaborative filtering models make recommendations based on the preferences of similar users, while content-based filtering models make recommendations based on the attributes of the items.

The mathematical model for collaborative filtering can be represented as:

\[ \text{推荐分数} = \text{用户相似度} \times \text{物品特征相似度} \]

Example:

Using a collaborative filtering model to recommend fashion items.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the user and item features
user_preferences = np.array([[3, 2, 5], [1, 5, 4], [4, 3, 2]])
item_features = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]])

# Calculate the user-item similarity matrix
similarity_matrix = np.dot(user_preferences, item_features.T)

# Calculate the weighted average of the item features for each user
recommendations = np.dot(similarity_matrix, item_features)

print("Recommendations:", recommendations)
```

### 5. Project Practice: Code Instances and Detailed Explanations

##### 5.1.1 Tools and Software

- **AR Tools**: Vuforia, ARKit (for iOS), ARCore (for Android)
- **VR Tools**: Unity, Unreal Engine
- **AI Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch

##### 5.1.2 Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Vuforia**: Download and install Vuforia SDK from the Vuforia Developer website.
2. **Configure Unity Project**: Create a new Unity project and import the Vuforia plugin.
3. **Install TensorFlow**: Install TensorFlow and its dependencies on your machine.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

#### 5.2 Detailed Code Implementation

##### 5.2.1 Augmented Reality (AR) Clothing Display

Here's a sample Unity script for displaying a virtual clothing item using AR.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using Vuforia;

public class ARClothingDisplay : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ImageTargetController targetController;
    public GameObject clothingPrefab;

    void Start()
    {
        VuforiaARController.Instance.InitAR();
        targetController.AddTarget("clothing_target");
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (targetController.TargetFound("clothing_target"))
        {
            // Create the clothing item at the target position
            Instantiate(clothingPrefab, targetController.GetTargetPosition("clothing_target"), 
                        targetController.GetTargetRotation("clothing_target"));
        }
    }
}
```

This script initializes the AR session, adds an image target for tracking, and displays a virtual clothing item when the target is found.

##### 5.2.2 Virtual Reality (VR) Fashion Show

Here's a sample Unity script for a VR fashion show that follows the user's movements.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class VRFashionShow : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject virtualModel;

    void Start()
    {
        VRManager.Instance.InitVR();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if (VRManager.Instance.VRModeActive)
        {
            // Move the virtual model to the user's position
            virtualModel.transform.position = VRManager.Instance.HeadTransform.position;
            virtualModel.transform.rotation = VRManager.Instance.HeadTransform.rotation;
        }
    }
}
```

This script initializes the VR environment and updates the virtual model's position to follow the user's head movements.

##### 5.2.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Fashion Recommendation

Here's a sample Python script for generating fashion recommendations using AI.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the trained AI model
model = load_model('fashion_recommendation_model.h5')

# Generate recommendations for a user
user_preferences = np.array([[3, 2, 5], [1, 5, 4], [4, 3, 2]])
recommendations = model.predict(user_preferences)

print("Recommended items:", recommendations)
```

This script loads a pre-trained AI model and uses it to generate fashion recommendations based on user preferences.

#### 5.3 Code Explanation and Analysis

In this section, we provide detailed explanations and analysis of the code examples provided in the previous sections.

##### 5.3.1 Augmented Reality (AR) Clothing Display

The ARClothingDisplay script initializes the AR session using Vuforia and adds an image target for tracking. When the target is found, it instantiates a virtual clothing item at the target's position and orientation.

```csharp
void Start()
{
    VuforiaARController.Instance.InitAR();
    targetController.AddTarget("clothing_target");
}
```

The `InitAR()` method initializes the AR session, and `AddTarget()` adds an image target named "clothing_target" for tracking.

```csharp
void Update()
{
    if (targetController.TargetFound("clothing_target"))
    {
        Instantiate(clothingPrefab, targetController.GetTargetPosition("clothing_target"), 
                    targetController.GetTargetRotation("clothing_target"));
    }
}
```

The `TargetFound()` method checks if the "clothing_target" is visible, and if so, it instantiates the virtual clothing item at the target's position using `Instantiate()`. The `GetTargetPosition()` and `GetTargetRotation()` methods retrieve the position and orientation of the target, respectively.

##### 5.2.2 Virtual Reality (VR) Fashion Show

The VRFashionShow script initializes the VR environment using a VRManager. It updates the virtual model's position and rotation to follow the user's head movements.

```csharp
void Start()
{
    VRManager.Instance.InitVR();
}
```

The `InitVR()` method initializes the VR environment.

```csharp
void Update()
{
    if (VRManager.Instance.VRModeActive)
    {
        virtualModel.transform.position = VRManager.Instance.HeadTransform.position;
        virtualModel.transform.rotation = VRManager.Instance.HeadTransform.rotation;
    }
}
```

The `VRModeActive` property checks if VR mode is active. If so, the script updates the virtual model's position and rotation to match the user's head position and orientation.

##### 5.2.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Fashion Recommendation

The AI fashion recommendation script loads a pre-trained AI model and generates recommendations for a user based on their preferences.

```python
model = load_model('fashion_recommendation_model.h5')
user_preferences = np.array([[3, 2, 5], [1, 5, 4], [4, 3, 2]])
recommendations = model.predict(user_preferences)
```

The `load_model()` function loads the pre-trained AI model from a file. `user_preferences` is a numpy array representing the user's fashion preferences. The `predict()` function of the model generates recommendations based on the user's preferences.
