In the realm of brand positioning and reinvention, mathematical models and formulas play a crucial role in quantifying and optimizing various aspects of the process. Below are some key mathematical models and their detailed explanations along with examples:

#### 4.1 Market Share Calculation

**Model**: Market share is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Market Share} = \frac{\text{Brand Sales}}{\text{Total Market Sales}} \times 100\% \]

**Example**:
A brand has annual sales of $10 million out of a total market sales of $100 million. The market share would be:

\[ \text{Market Share} = \frac{10}{100} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

#### 4.2 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Model**: Customer Lifetime Value is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{CLV} = \text{Average Revenue Per Customer} \times \text{Customer Lifetime} \]

**Example**:
If the average revenue per customer is $100 per year and the average customer lifetime is 5 years, the CLV would be:

\[ \text{CLV} = 100 \times 5 = $500 \]

#### 4.3 Brand Awareness Index

**Model**: Brand Awareness Index is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Brand Awareness Index} = \frac{\text{Awareness Among Target Audience}}{\text{Total Population}} \times 100\% \]

**Example**:
If 80% of the target audience is aware of the brand out of a total population of 1 million, the Brand Awareness Index would be:

\[ \text{Brand Awareness Index} = \frac{80}{1000} \times 100\% = 8\% \]

#### 4.4 Competitive Pricing Strategy

**Model**: The competitive pricing strategy can be formulated using the formula:

\[ \text{Price} = \text{Competitor Price} \times \left(1 + \text{Marginal Cost Increase}\right) \]

**Example**:
If a competitor's price is $100 and the marginal cost increase is 10%, the new price would be:

\[ \text{Price} = 100 \times \left(1 + 0.1\right) = $110 \]

#### 4.5 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Model**: Customer Acquisition Cost is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{CAC} = \frac{\text{Total Marketing Expenses}}{\text{Number of New Customers}} \]

**Example**:
If the total marketing expenses are $50,000 and the brand acquires 1,000 new customers, the CAC would be:

\[ \text{CAC} = \frac{50000}{1000} = $50 \]

By leveraging these mathematical models and formulas, brands can make data-driven decisions to optimize their positioning strategies, improve market share, enhance customer engagement, and drive overall business growth.

### 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In the realm of brand positioning and reinvention, mathematical models and formulas are invaluable tools for quantifying and optimizing various aspects of the process. Below, we delve into some essential mathematical models along with detailed explanations and illustrative examples.

#### 4.1 Market Share Calculation

**Model**: The market share of a brand is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{Market Share} = \left(\frac{\text{Brand Sales}}{\text{Total Market Sales}}\right) \times 100\% \]

**Example**:
Consider a scenario where a brand has generated $10 million in sales over the past year, while the total market sales for that period were $100 million. The brand's market share can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Market Share} = \left(\frac{10,000,000}{100,000,000}\right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

This calculation indicates that the brand captures 10% of the total market share within its industry.

#### 4.2 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Model**: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric that helps brands understand the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their entire relationship with the brand. The CLV formula is:

\[ \text{CLV} = \text{Average Revenue Per Customer} \times \text{Customer Lifetime} \]

**Example**:
A brand has an average customer lifetime of 5 years and an average revenue per customer of $500 per year. The CLV can be calculated as:

\[ \text{CLV} = 500 \times 5 = $2,500 \]

This example suggests that, on average, each customer contributes $2,500 in revenue to the brand over their entire relationship.

#### 4.3 Brand Awareness Index

**Model**: The Brand Awareness Index measures the level of recognition a brand has among its target audience. It is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Brand Awareness Index} = \left(\frac{\text{Awareness Among Target Audience}}{\text{Total Population}}\right) \times 100\% \]

**Example**:
Assume a brand has a target audience of 1 million individuals, and 80% of them are aware of the brand. The Brand Awareness Index would be:

\[ \text{Brand Awareness Index} = \left(\frac{800,000}{1,000,000}\right) \times 100\% = 80\% \]

This indicates that the brand has an 80% recognition rate within its target demographic.

#### 4.4 Competitive Pricing Strategy

**Model**: To set a competitive price, a brand might use the following formula:

\[ \text{Price} = \text{Competitor Price} \times \left(1 + \text{Marginal Cost Increase}\right) \]

**Example**:
If a competitor's price for a product is $100, and the brand anticipates a 10% increase in marginal costs, the new price would be:

\[ \text{Price} = 100 \times \left(1 + 0.10\right) = $110 \]

This formula ensures that the brand's pricing remains competitive while accounting for additional costs.

#### 4.5 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Model**: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is an important metric that indicates the cost of acquiring a new customer. It is calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{CAC} = \frac{\text{Total Marketing Expenses}}{\text{Number of New Customers}} \]

**Example**:
A brand spends $50,000 on marketing activities over a given period and acquires 1,000 new customers. The CAC can be calculated as:

\[ \text{CAC} = \frac{50,000}{1,000} = $50 \]

Understanding the CAC helps the brand assess the efficiency of its marketing efforts and make data-driven decisions to optimize its customer acquisition strategy.

By employing these mathematical models and formulas, brands can make informed decisions that enhance their positioning strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive overall business growth.

plt.show()
```

Here, we use K-means clustering to segment the market into clusters. The `KMeans` class from the `sklearn.cluster` module is used to perform the clustering. The `fit_predict` method trains the model and predicts cluster labels for the data. We evaluate the quality of the segmentation using the silhouette score, which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates better clustering.

The last part of this section visualizes the clusters using a scatter plot, where each point represents a customer in the market, and the color represents the assigned cluster.

In this section, we use the K-means algorithm to segment the market into clusters. The `KMeans` class from the `sklearn.cluster` module is used to perform the clustering. The `fit_predict` method trains the model and assigns cluster labels to the data points. We then evaluate the quality of the segmentation using the silhouette score, which measures how similar each object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates better clustering.

The visualization part uses a scatter plot to show the clusters in two dimensions. Each point represents a customer in the market, and the color represents the assigned cluster.

```

These lines define the brand's vision and mission as strings. These statements should be carefully crafted to reflect the brand's aspirations and core values.

##### 5.3.4 发展品牌定位策略

```python
positioning_statement = "We are the trusted partner for [Target Audience], providing [Value Proposition] through [Key Differentiators]."
```

This line constructs a positioning statement that encapsulates the brand's unique value proposition, target audience, and key differentiators. This statement will be used in all brand communications to maintain consistency.

##### 5.3.5 实施品牌重塑计划

```python
# Update the brand's visual identity
# ...
```

This section is where you would implement the updates to the brand's visual identity, such as a new logo, color scheme, and typography, all aligned with the new brand positioning.

##### 5.3.6 监控与优化

```python
# Monitor brand performance using KPIs
# ...
```

This part of the code involves setting up a system to monitor the brand's performance using key performance indicators (KPIs), such as brand awareness, customer satisfaction, and sales growth. This data will be used to continuously optimize the brand positioning strategy.

#### 5.4 运行结果展示

After running the code, you will get the following outputs:
