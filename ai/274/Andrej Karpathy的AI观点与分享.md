The backpropagation algorithm, used to train neural networks, involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters. The gradient can be computed using the chain rule of differentiation.

### 4.3 Case Analysis and Explanation

Consider a simple example of training a neural network to classify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset). The mathematical model for this task would involve a neural network architecture (e.g., CNN), a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy), and an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).

import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Define the CNN model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout2d(0.25)
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout2d(0.5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    #... (forward method and other methods)

#... (data loading, model initialization, training loop)
```
