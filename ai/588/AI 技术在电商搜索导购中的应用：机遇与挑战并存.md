在了解了核心算法原理和具体操作步骤后，我们将进一步探讨相关的数学模型和公式。以下将介绍协同过滤算法和图神经网络推荐算法中的主要数学模型和公式，并进行详细讲解和举例说明。

### 4.1 协同过滤算法的数学模型

协同过滤算法主要涉及用户相似度计算和推荐商品计算两个部分。

#### 用户相似度计算

假设有 \( n \) 个用户和 \( m \) 个商品，用户-商品评分矩阵为 \( R \)，则用户 \( i \) 和用户 \( j \) 之间的相似度可以通过以下公式计算：

\[ \text{similarity}(i, j) = \frac{R_{i\ast}R_{j\ast}}{\sqrt{||R_i||_2^2||R_j||_2^2}} \]

其中，\( R_{i\ast} \) 和 \( R_{j\ast} \) 分别表示用户 \( i \) 和用户 \( j \) 对所有商品的评分之和，\( ||R_i||_2 \) 和 \( ||R_j||_2 \) 分别表示用户 \( i \) 和用户 \( j \) 的评分向量的欧氏范数。

#### 推荐商品计算

假设用户 \( i \) 的邻居用户集合为 \( N_i \)，则用户 \( i \) 对商品 \( k \) 的预测评分可以通过以下公式计算：

\[ \hat{R}_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j \in N_i} R_{jk} \cdot \text{similarity}(i, j)}{\sum_{j \in N_i} \text{similarity}(i, j)} \]

其中，\( R_{jk} \) 表示用户 \( j \) 对商品 \( k \) 的评分，\( \text{similarity}(i, j) \) 表示用户 \( i \) 和用户 \( j \) 之间的相似度。

### 4.2 图神经网络推荐算法的数学模型

图神经网络推荐算法主要涉及图结构构建、图神经网络训练和推荐商品计算三个部分。

#### 图结构构建

假设有 \( n \) 个用户和 \( m \) 个商品，用户-商品交互数据为 \( D \)，则用户 \( i \) 和商品 \( k \) 之间的交互关系可以通过以下公式表示：

\[ E_{ik} = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } (i, k) \in D \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

其中，\( E \) 是图 \( G \) 的边集，\( D \) 是用户-商品交互数据集。

#### 图神经网络训练

图神经网络可以表示为 \( G = (V, E, X, Y) \)，其中 \( V \) 是图 \( G \) 的节点集，\( E \) 是图 \( G \) 的边集，\( X \) 是节点的特征向量，\( Y \) 是节点的标签向量。图神经网络的主要任务是学习节点特征向量 \( X \)，使得节点特征向量能够反映节点在图中的关系。

图神经网络可以表示为以下形式：

\[ X^{(t+1)} = \sigma(\mathbf{W}^{(t)} \cdot (X^{(t)} + \text{message}^{(t)})) \]

其中，\( \sigma \) 是激活函数，\( \mathbf{W}^{(t)} \) 是权重矩阵，\( \text{message}^{(t)} \) 是节点 \( i \) 在第 \( t \) 次迭代时的消息。

#### 推荐商品计算

假设用户 \( i \) 的邻居节点集合为 \( N_i \)，则用户 \( i \) 对商品 \( k \) 的预测评分可以通过以下公式计算：

\[ \hat{R}_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j \in N_i} X_j^T \cdot \text{weight}_{ij}}{\sum_{j \in N_i} \text{weight}_{ij}} \]

其中，\( X_j^T \) 是节点 \( j \) 的特征向量，\( \text{weight}_{ij} \) 是节点 \( i \) 和节点 \( j \) 之间的权重。

### 4.3 举例说明

#### 协同过滤算法举例

假设有 3 个用户（\( u_1, u_2, u_3 \)）和 3 个商品（\( g_1, g_2, g_3 \)），用户-商品评分矩阵如下：

\[ R = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

1. **计算用户相似度**：

用户 \( u_1 \) 和用户 \( u_2 \) 之间的相似度：

\[ \text{similarity}(u_1, u_2) = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}} \approx 0.55 \]

用户 \( u_2 \) 和用户 \( u_3 \) 之间的相似度：

\[ \text{similarity}(u_2, u_3) = \frac{0 \cdot 1}{\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = 0 \]

2. **推荐商品计算**：

用户 \( u_1 \) 的邻居用户集合为 \( N_{u_1} = \{ u_2 \} \)，则用户 \( u_1 \) 对商品 \( g_2 \) 的预测评分：

\[ \hat{R}_{u_1g_2} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.55}{0.55} = 1 \]

用户 \( u_2 \) 的邻居用户集合为 \( N_{u_2} = \{ u_1, u_3 \} \)，则用户 \( u_2 \) 对商品 \( g_3 \) 的预测评分：

\[ \hat{R}_{u_2g_3} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.55 + 1 \cdot 0}{0.55 + 0} = 0.55 \]

#### 图神经网络推荐算法举例

假设有 3 个用户（\( u_1, u_2, u_3 \)）和 3 个商品（\( g_1, g_2, g_3 \)），用户-商品交互数据如下：

\[ D = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

1. **构建图结构**：

用户-商品交互矩阵 \( E \)：

\[ E = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

2. **图神经网络训练**：

假设图神经网络模型为 \( G = (V, E, X, Y) \)，其中 \( X \) 为节点特征向量，\( Y \) 为节点标签向量。经过训练后，得到的节点特征向量 \( X \)：

\[ X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} \]

3. **推荐商品计算**：

用户 \( u_1 \) 的邻居节点集合为 \( N_{u_1} = \{ u_2 \} \)，则用户 \( u_1 \) 对商品 \( g_2 \) 的预测评分：

\[ \hat{R}_{u_1g_2} = \frac{1^T \cdot 1}{1^T \cdot 1} = 1 \]

用户 \( u_2 \) 的邻居节点集合为 \( N_{u_2} = \{ u_1, u_3 \} \)，则用户 \( u_2 \) 对商品 \( g_3 \) 的预测评分：

\[ \hat{R}_{u_2g_3} = \frac{1^T \cdot 1 + 1^T \cdot 1}{1^T \cdot 1 + 1^T \cdot 1} = 1 \]

## 1. Background Introduction

E-commerce search and guided shopping are crucial components of the e-commerce ecosystem, directly affecting the user experience and sales performance of merchants. Traditional e-commerce search and guided shopping primarily rely on keyword searches and product categorization, but this approach has many limitations, such as inaccurate search results and difficulties in meeting user needs. With the development of AI technology, particularly machine learning, natural language processing, and graph neural networks, e-commerce search and guided shopping are gradually transitioning from a keyword-based approach to a semantic understanding and recommendation-based approach.

### 1.1 Current Status of E-commerce Search and Guided Shopping

E-commerce search and guided shopping applications are already quite widespread, as evidenced by the search functions of major e-commerce platforms such as Taobao, JD.com, and Pinduoduo. However, existing e-commerce search and guided shopping systems still have some issues:

- Natural Language Processing: NLP is used to understand and parse user-entered keywords, thereby improving the accuracy of search matching.
- Graph Neural Networks: By constructing a graph structure of products and users, graph neural networks can analyze the relationships between users and products, enabling more precise recommendations.

## 2. Core Concepts and Connections

Before delving into the application of AI technology in e-commerce search and guided shopping, it is essential to understand some core concepts and principles related to AI. This section introduces several core concepts, including machine learning, natural language processing, and graph neural networks, and explains their application in e-commerce search and guided shopping.

### 2.1 Machine Learning

Machine learning is a technology that enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or classifications. In e-commerce search and guided shopping, machine learning can be used for the following purposes:

- Search result ranking: By analyzing user behavior data, such as browsing history and purchase patterns, machine learning models can predict user needs and rank search results accordingly.
- User behavior analysis: By analyzing user clicks, purchases, and other behaviors, machine learning models can understand user preferences and provide personalized recommendations.

### 2.2 Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, generate, and process natural language. In e-commerce search and guided shopping, NLP can be used for the following purposes:

- Keyword extraction: Extracting key information from user-entered keywords to improve search matching accuracy.
- Text generation: Generating personalized product recommendation texts based on user needs and preferences.

### 2.3 Graph Neural Networks

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network that operates on graph-structured data. In e-commerce search and guided shopping, GNNs can be used for the following purposes:

- User and product relationship analysis: By constructing a graph structure of users and products, GNNs can analyze the relationships between users and products, enabling more precise recommendations.
- Social network analysis: By analyzing user behavior and relationships in social networks, GNNs can provide recommendations that align with the user's social circle.

## 3. Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

Having understood the applications of AI technology in e-commerce search and guided shopping, we will now delve into the core algorithm principles and specific operational steps. This section will introduce two widely used algorithms in e-commerce search and guided shopping: collaborative filtering and graph neural network recommendation.

### 3.1 Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

Collaborative filtering is a recommendation algorithm that relies on user behavior data, such as purchases and clicks. The core idea is to analyze the similarity between users and recommend products that similar users have liked. The specific operational steps are as follows:

1. **User-Product Rating Matrix Construction**: Based on user behavior data, such as purchases and clicks, a user-product rating matrix is constructed.
2. **Similarity Calculation**: The similarity between users is calculated. Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient.
3. **Recommendation Product Calculation**: For each user, the average rating of similar users' products is calculated, and the products are sorted according to the ratings to recommend to the user.

### 3.2 Graph Neural Network Recommendation Algorithm

Graph Neural Network (GNN) recommendation is a recommendation algorithm based on graph-structured data. The core idea is to construct a graph structure of users and products, analyze the relationships between them using GNNs, and then recommend products. The specific operational steps are as follows:

1. **Graph Structure Construction**: Based on user and product data, a graph structure of users and products is constructed. Nodes represent users and products, and edges represent interactions between them.
2. **Graph Neural Network Training**: The graph-structured data is fed into a GNN to train the model, learning the relationships between users and products.
3. **Recommendation Product Calculation**: Using the embeddings generated by the GNN, the interest level of users in products is calculated, and the products are sorted according to the interest levels to recommend to the user.

## 4. Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Example Illustration

After understanding the core algorithm principles and specific operational steps, we will delve into the related mathematical models and formulas. This section will introduce the main mathematical models and formulas in collaborative filtering and GNN recommendation algorithms, and provide detailed explanations and example illustrations.

### 4.1 Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Mathematical Models

Collaborative filtering algorithms primarily involve user similarity calculation and recommendation product calculation.

#### User Similarity Calculation

Assuming there are \( n \) users and \( m \) products, and the user-product rating matrix is \( R \), the similarity between user \( i \) and user \( j \) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \text{similarity}(i, j) = \frac{R_{i\ast}R_{j\ast}}{\sqrt{||R_i||_2^2||R_j||_2^2}} \]

where \( R_{i\ast} \) and \( R_{j\ast} \) are the sums of ratings for all products of users \( i \) and \( j \), respectively, and \( ||R_i||_2 \) and \( ||R_j||_2 \) are the Euclidean norms of the rating vectors for users \( i \) and \( j \), respectively.

#### Recommendation Product Calculation

Assuming the set of neighbors for user \( i \) is \( N_i \), the predicted rating for user \( i \) on product \( k \) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \hat{R}_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j \in N_i} R_{jk} \cdot \text{similarity}(i, j)}{\sum_{j \in N_i} \text{similarity}(i, j)} \]

where \( R_{jk} \) is the rating of user \( j \) on product \( k \), and \( \text{similarity}(i, j) \) is the similarity between users \( i \) and \( j \).

### 4.2 Graph Neural Network Recommendation Algorithm Mathematical Models

Graph Neural Network (GNN) recommendation algorithms primarily involve graph structure construction, GNN training, and recommendation product calculation.

#### Graph Structure Construction

Assuming there are \( n \) users and \( m \) products, and the user-product interaction data is \( D \), the interaction between user \( i \) and product \( k \) can be represented as follows:

\[ E_{ik} = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } (i, k) \in D \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

where \( E \) is the edge set of graph \( G \), and \( D \) is the user-product interaction data set.

#### Graph Neural Network Training

Assuming the GNN model is \( G = (V, E, X, Y) \), where \( V \) is the node set of graph \( G \), \( E \) is the edge set of graph \( G \), \( X \) is the node feature vector, and \( Y \) is the node label vector, the core task of GNN is to learn the node feature vector \( X \) such that it can reflect the relationships between nodes in the graph.

The GNN can be represented as follows:

\[ X^{(t+1)} = \sigma(\mathbf{W}^{(t)} \cdot (X^{(t)} + \text{message}^{(t)})) \]

where \( \sigma \) is the activation function, \( \mathbf{W}^{(t)} \) is the weight matrix, and \( \text{message}^{(t)} \) is the message for node \( i \) at the \( t \)-th iteration.

#### Recommendation Product Calculation

Assuming the set of neighbors for user \( i \) is \( N_i \), the predicted rating for user \( i \) on product \( k \) can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ \hat{R}_{ik} = \frac{\sum_{j \in N_i} X_j^T \cdot \text{weight}_{ij}}{\sum_{j \in N_i} \text{weight}_{ij}} \]

where \( X_j^T \) is the feature vector of node \( j \), and \( \text{weight}_{ij} \) is the weight between nodes \( i \) and \( j \).

### 4.3 Example Illustration

#### Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Example

Assume there are 3 users (\( u_1, u_2, u_3 \)) and 3 products (\( g_1, g_2, g_3 \)), and the user-product rating matrix is as follows:

\[ R = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

1. **Calculate User Similarity**:

The similarity between user \( u_1 \) and user \( u_2 \):

\[ \text{similarity}(u_1, u_2) = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}} \approx 0.55 \]

The similarity between user \( u_2 \) and user \( u_3 \):

\[ \text{similarity}(u_2, u_3) = \frac{0 \cdot 1}{\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} \cdot \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}} = 0 \]

2. **Recommendation Product Calculation**:

The neighbor set of user \( u_1 \) is \( N_{u_1} = \{ u_2 \} \), so the predicted rating of user \( u_1 \) on product \( g_2 \):

\[ \hat{R}_{u_1g_2} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.55}{0.55} = 1 \]

The neighbor set of user \( u_2 \) is \( N_{u_2} = \{ u_1, u_3 \} \), so the predicted rating of user \( u_2 \) on product \( g_3 \):

\[ \hat{R}_{u_2g_3} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.55 + 1 \cdot 0}{0.55 + 0} = 0.55 \]

#### Graph Neural Network Recommendation Algorithm Example

Assume there are 3 users (\( u_1, u_2, u_3 \)) and 3 products (\( g_1, g_2, g_3 \)), and the user-product interaction data is as follows:

\[ D = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

1. **Construct Graph Structure**:

The user-product interaction matrix \( E \) is:

\[ E = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \]

2. **Train Graph Neural Network Model**:

Assume the GNN model is \( G = (V, E, X, Y) \), where \( X \) is the node feature vector, and \( Y \) is the node label vector. After training, the node feature vector \( X \) is obtained:

\[ X = \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} \]

3. **Recommendation Product Calculation**:

The neighbor set of user \( u_1 \) is \( N_{u_1} = \{ u_2 \} \), so the predicted rating of user \( u_1 \) on product \( g_2 \):

\[ \hat{R}_{u_1g_2} = \frac{1^T \cdot 1}{1^T \cdot 1} = 1 \]

The neighbor set of user \( u_2 \) is \( N_{u_2} = \{ u_1, u_3 \} \), so the predicted rating of user \( u_2 \) on product \( g_3 \):

\[ \hat{R}_{u_2g_3} = \frac{1^T \cdot 1 + 1^T \cdot 1}{1^T \cdot 1 + 1^T \cdot 1} = 1 \]
