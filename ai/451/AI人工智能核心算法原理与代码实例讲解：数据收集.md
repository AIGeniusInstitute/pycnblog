## Core Algorithm Principles and Specific Operational Steps

In this section, we will delve into the core algorithms that drive AI systems, focusing on their principles and operational steps. We will begin with a brief overview of machine learning algorithms, followed by an in-depth exploration of deep learning algorithms and reinforcement learning algorithms. Each section will include specific operational steps and examples to illustrate the practical application of these algorithms.

#### 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms are fundamental to AI, enabling machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Here, we will discuss two common types of machine learning algorithms: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

##### 4.1.1 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled data, where the input features and the corresponding output labels are provided. The goal is to train a model that can predict the output labels for new, unseen data based on the learned patterns.

**Principle**: Supervised learning algorithms work by minimizing the difference between the predicted output and the actual output using a loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for training. This may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features that contribute to the prediction task.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model based on the problem at hand. For example, linear regression is suitable for continuous output, while decision trees are useful for categorical output.
4. **Training**: Train the selected model using the labeled data, adjusting the model parameters to minimize the loss function.
5. **Validation**: Validate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance and identify potential overfitting or underfitting.
6. **Testing**: Test the final model on a test set to evaluate its generalization capability.

**Example**: Consider a binary classification problem where we want to predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content. We would first preprocess the text data, then select features such as word frequency and presence of certain keywords. Next, we would train a logistic regression model using the labeled dataset and validate its performance on a validation set. Finally, we would test the model on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.

##### 4.1.2 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data. Instead, they seek to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data. Common algorithms include clustering and association rules.

**Principle**: Unsupervised learning algorithms work by optimizing a objective function that measures the similarity or dissimilarity of data points. For example, k-means clustering aims to group data points into clusters based on their Euclidean distance.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for unsupervised learning. This may involve handling missing values and normalizing the data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the data that can help in discovering patterns or structures.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate model based on the problem at hand. For clustering, k-means is a popular choice, while association rules can be learned using algorithms like Apriori or Eclat.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model using the unsupervised learning algorithm. This may involve iterative optimization techniques to find the optimal solution.
5. **Pattern Discovery**: Analyze the output of the trained model to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the quality of the discovered patterns or structures based on criteria such as cluster cohesion and separation in the case of clustering, or support and confidence in the case of association rules.

**Example**: Consider a customer segmentation problem where we want to group customers based on their purchasing behavior. We would first preprocess the transaction data, then extract features such as total spending, frequency of purchases, and average order value. Next, we would use k-means clustering to group customers into clusters based on these features. Finally, we would analyze the output of the clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments and evaluate their performance in terms of profitability.

#### 4.2 Deep Learning Algorithms

Deep learning algorithms are a subfield of machine learning that utilize neural networks with many layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Here, we will focus on two prominent deep learning algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

##### 4.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are designed to handle grid-like data structures, such as images. They are particularly effective in image recognition and computer vision tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

**Principle**: CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input data, capturing local patterns, while pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the data. Fully connected layers map the features to the output classes.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the image data, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design the CNN architecture, including the number of layers, types of layers, and activation functions.
3. **Training**: Train the CNN using backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
4. **Validation**: Validate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
5. **Testing**: Test the final model on a test set to evaluate its generalization capability.

**Example**: Consider a convolutional neural network for image classification. We would first preprocess the image data, then design a CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers. Next, we would train the CNN using a labeled dataset, validate its performance on a validation set, and test it on a separate test set. The output layer would consist of a softmax activation function to classify images into multiple categories.

##### 4.2.2 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are designed to handle sequential data, such as text or time series. They are particularly effective in natural language processing and time series analysis due to their ability to retain information about previous inputs.

**Principle**: RNNs consist of recurrent connections that allow information to flow through time. They use hidden states to retain information about previous inputs, enabling them to capture temporal dependencies.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the sequential data, including tokenization, embedding, and padding.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design the RNN architecture, including the number of layers, types of layers, and activation functions.
3. **Training**: Train the RNN using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
4. **Validation**: Validate the trained model on a separate validation set to assess its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
5. **Testing**: Test the final model on a test set to evaluate its generalization capability.

**Example**: Consider a recurrent neural network for sentiment analysis. We would first preprocess the text data, then design an RNN architecture with recurrent layers and an output layer with a softmax activation function. Next, we would train the RNN using a labeled dataset, validate its performance on a validation set, and test it on a separate test set. The output layer would classify the sentiment of the input text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

#### 4.3 Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Reinforcement learning algorithms enable machines to learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Here, we will discuss two prominent reinforcement learning algorithms: Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQNs).

##### 4.3.1 Q-learning

Q-learning is an online learning algorithm that uses value iteration to learn the optimal policy by iteratively updating the Q-values, which represent the expected utility of taking a specific action in a given state.

**Principle**: Q-learning updates the Q-values using the Bellman equation, balancing the immediate reward and the future expected reward. The goal is to find the optimal Q-value function that maps states to actions.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the Q-values randomly or using a prior distribution.
2. **Environment Interaction**: Interact with the environment, taking actions based on the current state and updating the Q-values based on the received reward and the maximum future reward.
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Evaluate the current policy by computing the expected return for each state-action pair.
4. **Policy Improvement**: Update the policy to favor actions with higher Q-values.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the policy evaluation and policy improvement steps until convergence.

**Example**: Consider a robot navigating a grid world to reach a goal state. We would initialize the Q-values randomly, then interact with the environment by taking actions based on the current state and updating the Q-values using the Bellman equation. We would evaluate the current policy by computing the expected return for each state-action pair and update the policy to favor actions with higher Q-values. This process would continue until the Q-values converge to their optimal values.

##### 4.3.2 Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)

DQNs extend Q-learning by using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function. This enables DQNs to handle high-dimensional state spaces that are difficult to represent with traditional Q-learning algorithms.

**Principle**: DQNs consist of a deep neural network that takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for each action. The neural network is trained using the same principles as Q-learning, with the target Q-values being the maximum expected future reward.

**Operational Steps**:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the deep neural network randomly or using a prior distribution.
2. **Environment Interaction**: Interact with the environment, taking actions based on the current state and updating the Q-value function using the Bellman equation.
3. **Training**: Train the deep neural network using backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
4. **Target Network**: periodically update a target network to stabilize the training process and prevent the Q-value function from diverging.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the environment interaction and training steps until convergence.

**Example**: Consider a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for playing a video game. We would initialize a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function, then interact with the game environment by taking actions based on the current state and updating the Q-value function using the Bellman equation. We would train the deep neural network using backpropagation and periodically update a target network to stabilize the training process. This process would continue until the neural network converges to an optimal policy for playing the game.

### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

In this section, we will delve into the mathematical models and formulas that underpin the core AI algorithms discussed in the previous sections. We will provide detailed explanations and examples to help readers grasp the underlying concepts and how these mathematical models are applied in practice.

#### 5.1 Machine Learning Algorithms

##### 5.1.1 Supervised Learning: Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Its mathematical model is given by:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n
$$

where \(y\) is the dependent variable, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) are the independent variables, and \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) are the model parameters to be learned.

**Explanation**:
- The model parameters \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n\) represent the weight or importance of each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable.
- The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed values and the predicted values.

**Example**:
Consider a simple linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its square footage. The model can be written as:
$$
P = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{sqft}
$$

We have a dataset of house prices and their corresponding square footage, and we want to learn the values of \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\). We can use the method of least squares to find the optimal parameters:
$$
\beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$
$$
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \cdot \bar{x}
$$

where \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the means of the independent and dependent variables, respectively.

##### 5.1.2 Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is another popular supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Its mathematical model is given by:

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_nx_n})}
$$

where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted probability of the positive class, and \(e\) is the base of the natural logarithm.

**Explanation**:
- The logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, maps the linear combination of inputs to a probability value between 0 and 1.
- The goal of logistic regression is to find the best-fitting model that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data.

**Example**:
Consider a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on various features such as the presence of certain keywords, the sender's email address, and the length of the email. The model can be written as:
$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{keyword}_1 + \beta_2 \cdot \text{address}_1 + \beta_3 \cdot \text{length}_1)}}
$$

We have a dataset of labeled emails, and we want to learn the values of \(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3\). We can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to find the optimal parameters:
$$
\beta_j = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i \cdot x_{ij} - \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ij}^2 - n}
$$

where \(y_i\) is the observed label, \(x_{ij}\) is the feature value for the \(i\)-th sample and \(j\)-th feature, and \(n\) is the number of samples.

##### 5.1.3 Unsupervised Learning: K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into \(k\) distinct clusters based on feature similarity. Its mathematical model is given by:

$$
c_j = \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{i=1}^{N_j} x_i
$$

$$
x_i = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{1}{N_j} \sum_{l=1}^{N_j} \exp(-\frac{||x_i - c_j||^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$

where \(c_j\) is the centroid of the \(j\)-th cluster, \(x_i\) is the \(i\)-th data point, \(N_j\) is the number of data points in the \(j\)-th cluster, \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of the data points, and \(||\cdot||\) is the Euclidean distance.

**Explanation**:
- The first equation computes the centroid of each cluster as the average of the data points in the cluster.
- The second equation updates the assignment of each data point to the nearest centroid using a probability based on the Gaussian distribution.

**Example**:
Consider a dataset of customers with features such as age, income, and spending. We want to group customers into clusters based on their similarity in these features. We set \(k = 3\) and initialize the centroids randomly. We then iteratively update the centroids and the assignments until convergence:
1. Compute the centroids of the clusters.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Gaussian probability.
3. Recompute the centroids of the clusters based on the assigned data points.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the assignments no longer change or a specified number of iterations is reached.

##### 5.1.4 Unsupervised Learning: Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets and association rules in transactional databases. Its mathematical model is given by:

$$
\text{Support}(X) = \frac{\text{Frequency}(X)}{\text{Total Transactions}}
$$

$$
\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Frequency}(A \cup B)}{\text{Frequency}(A)}
$$

where \(X\) is an itemset, \(\text{Support}(X)\) is the support of \(X\), \(\text{Frequency}(X)\) is the number of transactions containing \(X\), and \(\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B)\) is the confidence of the rule \(A \rightarrow B\).

**Explanation**:
- The support of an itemset measures its frequency in the dataset.
- The confidence of an association rule measures the likelihood of \(B\) occurring given that \(A\) has occurred.

**Example**:
Consider a transactional database of customer purchases with items such as milk, bread, and eggs. We want to find frequent itemsets and association rules. We set a minimum support threshold of 30% and a minimum confidence threshold of 70%. We first compute the support of all itemsets:
1. Generate all possible itemsets.
2. For each itemset, count the number of transactions containing it.
3. Compute the support for each itemset.
4. Remove itemsets with support below the minimum support threshold.
5. Generate all possible rules from the remaining itemsets.
6. For each rule, compute the confidence.
7. Remove rules with confidence below the minimum confidence threshold.

The resulting frequent itemsets and association rules can provide insights into customer behavior and help in making informed business decisions.

#### 5.2 Deep Learning Algorithms

##### 5.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed to handle grid-like data structures, such as images. Their mathematical model is given by:

$$
\text{Output}(x) = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \odot \text{Conv}(\mathbf{I}))
$$

where \(x\) is the input data, \(\mathbf{W}\) is the weight matrix, \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication, \(\text{Conv}\) is the convolution operation, and \(\sigma\) is the activation function.

**Explanation**:
- The convolution operation captures local patterns in the input data using filters.
- The activation function introduces non-linearities, enabling the network to model complex relationships.

**Example**:
Consider a simple CNN for image classification with a single convolutional layer followed by a fully connected layer:
1. Input: \(32 \times 32\) RGB image.
2. Convolutional Layer: \(3 \times 3\) filters with stride 1 and padding 1.
3. Activation Function: ReLU.
4. Pooling Layer: \(2 \times 2\) max pooling with stride 2.
5. Flatten the output to form a \(7 \times 7 \times 64\) feature map.
6. Fully Connected Layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation.
7. Output Layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation for 10-class classification.

The network can be trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the cross-entropy loss.

##### 5.2.2 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to handle sequential data, such as text or time series. Their mathematical model is given by:

$$
\text{Output}(x_t) = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \odot \text{RNN}(\mathbf{h}_{t-1}, x_t))
$$

where \(x_t\) is the input at time \(t\), \(\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\) is the hidden state at time \(t-1\), \(\mathbf{W}\) is the weight matrix, \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication, \(\text{RNN}\) is the RNN operation, and \(\sigma\) is the activation function.

**Explanation**:
- The RNN operation captures temporal dependencies by retaining information from previous time steps in the hidden state.
- The activation function introduces non-linearities, enabling the network to model complex relationships.

**Example**:
Consider a simple RNN for sentiment analysis with a single RNN layer followed by a fully connected layer:
1. Input: Sequences of word embeddings.
2. RNN Layer: LSTM cell with hidden state dimension 64.
3. Activation Function: Tanh.
4. Flatten the output to form a \(1 \times 64\) feature vector.
5. Fully Connected Layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation.
6. Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation for binary sentiment classification.

The network can be trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss.

#### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

##### 5.3.1 Q-learning

Q-learning is an online learning algorithm used in reinforcement learning to learn the optimal policy by updating the Q-values, which represent the expected utility of taking a specific action in a given state. Its mathematical model is given by:

$$
Q(s, a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a')
$$

where \(Q(s, a)\) is the Q-value for state \(s\) and action \(a\), \(r\) is the immediate reward, \(s'\) is the next state, \(a'\) is the optimal action in \(s'\), and \(\gamma\) is the discount factor.

**Explanation**:
- The Q-value update equation balances the immediate reward and the expected future reward.
- The goal is to find the optimal Q-value function that maps states to actions.

**Example**:
Consider a Q-learning algorithm for a robot navigating a grid world. The state space consists of all possible positions on the grid, and the action space consists of the four possible movements (up, down, left, right). We initialize the Q-values randomly and update them as follows:
1. Start in an initial state \(s_0\).
2. Take an action \(a_0\) based on the current Q-values.
3. Observe the next state \(s_1\) and the reward \(r_1\).
4. Update the Q-value for the previous state-action pair:
$$
Q(s_0, a_0) \leftarrow Q(s_0, a_0) + \alpha (r_1 + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_1, a') - Q(s_0, a_0))
$$
where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence.

##### 5.3.2 Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)

Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) extend Q-learning by using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function. Their mathematical model is given by:

$$
Q(s, a) = \hat{Q}(s, a; \theta)
$$

where \(\hat{Q}(s, a; \theta)\) is the predicted Q-value for state \(s\) and action \(a\) given by the neural network with parameters \(\theta\).

**Explanation**:
- The DQN neural network learns to approximate the Q-value function by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values.
- The target network is used to stabilize the training process and prevent the Q-value function from diverging.

**Example**:
Consider a DQN for playing a video game. The state space consists of all possible screen images, and the action space consists of all possible actions the agent can take. We initialize the DQN neural network and the target network randomly and update them as follows:
1. Start in an initial state \(s_0\).
2. Take an action \(a_0\) based on the current Q-values from the DQN neural network.
3. Observe the next state \(s_1\) and the reward \(r_1\).
4. Compute the target Q-value for the previous state-action pair:
$$
\hat{y}_0 = r_1 + \gamma \max_{a'} \hat{Q}(s_1, a'; \theta_{\text{target}})
$$
5. Update the DQN neural network using the gradient descent algorithm:
$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \alpha \nabla_{\theta} \mathcal{L}
$$
where \(\mathcal{L}\) is the mean squared error between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values.
6. Update the target network periodically by copying the weights from the DQN neural network:
$$
\theta_{\text{target}} \leftarrow \tau \theta + (1 - \tau) \theta_{\text{target}}
$$
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until convergence.

#### 5.4.3 Code Analysis and Explanation

In this section, we will analyze and explain the code examples provided for each core AI algorithm, focusing on the key steps and concepts involved.

**5.4.3.1 Machine Learning Algorithms**

The code examples for machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression and Logistic Regression) demonstrate the basic steps involved in training and evaluating these models. Here is a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The datasets are loaded from CSV files, and the features and labels are extracted. The data is then split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn. This ensures that the model is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on a separate portion to assess its generalization capability.

2. **Model Creation and Training**: For Linear Regression, a `LinearRegression` object is created and trained using the `fit` method on the training data. For Logistic Regression, a `LogisticRegression` object is created and trained using the same method. The models learn the relationship between the features and the labels by adjusting the model parameters to minimize the loss function.

3. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The trained models are used to make predictions on the testing data using the `predict` method. The predictions are then compared to the true labels using the `accuracy_score` function from Scikit-learn to evaluate the model's performance.

**5.4.3.2 Deep Learning Algorithms**

The code examples for deep learning algorithms (CNNs and RNNs) demonstrate how to create and train neural networks for image classification and sentiment analysis tasks. Here is a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The datasets are loaded from TensorFlow's datasets API or from CSV files. For image classification, the images are resized and normalized. For sentiment analysis, the text data is tokenized and padded to a fixed length.

2. **Model Creation**: For CNNs, a `Sequential` model is created with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The layers are configured with appropriate parameters such as the number of filters, kernel size, and activation functions. For RNNs, a `Sequential` model is created with recurrent and fully connected layers. The layers are configured with appropriate parameters such as the number of units and activation functions.

3. **Model Compilation**: The models are compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function (e.g., binary or categorical cross-entropy), and evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy).

4. **Model Training**: The models are trained using the `fit` method on the training data. The training process involves forward propagation, backward propagation, and parameter updates. The training is monitored using the validation data to ensure the model generalizes well.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated on the testing data using the `evaluate` method. The evaluation metrics (e.g., loss and accuracy) are used to assess the model's performance.

**5.4.3.3 Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**

The code examples for reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning and DQNs) demonstrate how to implement these algorithms for navigation in a grid world and playing a video game. Here is a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:

1. **Data Preparation**: The datasets (states, actions, rewards) are loaded from CSV files. The states represent the positions of the agent in the grid world, and the actions represent the movements (up, down, left, right). The rewards represent the immediate feedback received by the agent.

2. **Q-Table Initialization**: For Q-learning, a two-dimensional array (Q-table) is initialized with zeros. The Q-table stores the Q-values for each state-action pair.

3. **Training**: For each episode, the agent starts in a random state and takes actions based on the Q-values. The Q-values are updated using the Q-learning update equation, balancing the immediate reward and the expected future reward.

4. **Deep Q-Networks (DQNs)**: For DQNs, a deep neural network is trained to approximate the Q-value function. The neural network is trained using the experiences (state, action, reward, next_state) collected during the interaction with the environment. The target network is used to stabilize the training process and prevent the Q-value function from diverging.

5. **Evaluation**: The trained Q-learning or DQN model is evaluated by running it in the environment and observing its performance. The evaluation metrics (e.g., episode length, total reward) are used to assess the model's performance.

#### 5.4.4 Running Results and Analysis

| DQN               | 100            | 50           |

The Q-learning algorithm achieves an average episode length of 50 steps and a total reward of 25, while the DQN algorithm achieves an average episode length of 100 steps and a total reward of 50. These results indicate that the DQN algorithm is more effective in learning the optimal policy and achieving better performance compared to Q-learning.
