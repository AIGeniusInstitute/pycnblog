### Mathematical Models and Formulas

To further illustrate the role of AI in digital infrastructure, let's delve into some mathematical models and formulas that underpin the core AI techniques discussed above.

#### Machine Learning for Network Optimization

One common machine learning model used for network optimization is the neural network. A neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, where each layer performs a specific function. The output of the neural network is determined by the following formula:

$$
\text{Output} = f(\text{Weight} \cdot \text{Input} + \text{Bias})
$$

where \( f \) is the activation function, \(\text{Weight}\) and \(\text{Bias}\) are learned parameters that determine the strength of the connections between neurons.

#### Deep Learning for Security

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for security applications. A CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The output of a CNN is determined by the following formula:

$$
\text{Output} = \text{Conv}(\text{Input}) \cdot \text{Pooling}(\text{Input}) \cdot \text{FullyConnected}(\text{Input})
$$

where \(\text{Conv}\), \(\text{Pooling}\), and \(\text{FullyConnected}\) represent the operations performed by the convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, respectively.

#### Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficiency

Reinforcement learning models, such as Q-learning and deep Q-networks (DQN), are used for optimizing energy consumption in digital infrastructure. The Q-value of a state-action pair is updated based on the following formula:

$$
\text{Q}(s, a) \leftarrow \text{Q}(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} \text{Q}(s', a') - \text{Q}(s, a)]
$$

where \(\text{Q}(s, a)\) is the Q-value of the state-action pair, \( r \) is the reward received for taking action \( a \) in state \( s \), \(\gamma\) is the discount factor, and \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

### Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

To provide a concrete understanding of the AI techniques discussed above, let's explore some code examples and detailed explanations for implementing these techniques in digital infrastructure.

#### Machine Learning for Network Optimization

Consider the following Python code for training a neural network to optimize network traffic:

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize the neural network parameters
weights = np.random.rand(input_size, hidden_size)
biases = np.random.rand(hidden_size, output_size)
learning_rate = 0.1

# Define the activation function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the forward propagation function
def forwardPropagation(input_data):
    hidden_layer_input = np.dot(input_data, weights) + biases
    hidden_layer_output = sigmoid(hidden_layer_input)
    output_layer_input = np.dot(hidden_layer_output, weights) + biases
    output_layer_output = sigmoid(output_layer_input)
    return output_layer_output

# Define the training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for input_data, target in data_loader:
        output = forwardPropagation(input_data)
        error = target - output
        d_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(output)
        d_hidden_layer_input = np.dot(d_output, weights.T)
        d_hidden_layer_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer_output)
        d_weights = d_hidden_layer_input * hidden_layer_output.T
        d_biases = d_hidden_layer_output
        weights -= learning_rate * d_weights
        biases -= learning_rate * d_biases

# Test the trained model
test_output = forwardPropagation(test_input)
print("Test Output:", test_output)
```

This code trains a neural network on a dataset of network traffic data to predict future traffic patterns and optimize network performance. The training loop iterates through the dataset, performing forward propagation to compute the output of the neural network and calculating the error between the predicted output and the target output. The gradients of the error with respect to the weights and biases are then used to update the network parameters, minimizing the error over time.

#### Deep Learning for Security

Consider the following Python code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect security threats in network traffic:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the CNN architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test Loss:", test_loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", test_accuracy)
```

This code trains a CNN on a dataset of network traffic data containing both normal and malicious activities to detect security threats. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer and a sigmoid activation function. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, and trained on the training dataset. The performance of the trained model is evaluated on the test dataset.

#### Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficiency

Consider the following Python code for training a reinforcement learning agent to optimize energy consumption in a data center:

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize the reinforcement learning parameters
action_size = 3
state_size = 4
learning_rate = 0.1
gamma = 0.99

# Define the Q-learning algorithm
def q_learning(state, action, reward, next_state, done):
    Q[state][action] = Q[state][action] + learning_rate * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state][action])
    return Q

# Define the environment
def environment(state, action):
    if action == 0:
        # Increase server power
        new_state = state + 1
    elif action == 1:
        # Decrease server power
        new_state = state - 1
    elif action == 2:
        # No change
        new_state = state
    reward = 0
    if new_state < 0:
        # Invalid state
        reward = -1
    elif new_state == 0:
        # Optimal state
        reward = 1
    done = True if new_state == 0 else False
    return new_state, reward, done

# Define the training loop
Q = np.zeros((state_size, action_size))
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = np.random.randint(state_size)
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = np.argmax(Q[state])
        next_state, reward, done = environment(state, action)
        Q = q_learning(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state

# Test the trained agent
state = np.random.randint(state_size)
while True:
    action = np.argmax(Q[state])
    next_state, reward, done = environment(state, action)
    print("State:", state, "Action:", action, "Reward:", reward)
    if done:
        break
    state = next_state
```

This code trains a reinforcement learning agent using the Q-learning algorithm to optimize energy consumption in a data center. The agent operates in a discrete state space, where each state represents the current server power level. The agent can take three actions: increase server power, decrease server power, or do nothing. The Q-learning algorithm updates the Q-values based on the received reward and the maximum Q-value of the next state. The trained agent is then tested to optimize server power levels and minimize energy consumption.
