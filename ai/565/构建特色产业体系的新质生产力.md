特色产业体系是指在一定区域内，以特定产业为核心，通过产业链的延伸、产业间的协同与互补，形成的具有鲜明特色和竞争优势的产业综合体。该体系通常包括核心产业、相关产业和支持产业三个层次，其中核心产业是整个体系的主导力量，相关产业和支持产业则为其提供必要的配套服务和支撑。

In the context of this article, a "characteristic industry system" refers to a comprehensive industrial ecosystem within a specific region, centered around a particular industry. This system is characterized by the extension of industrial chains, synergistic and complementary interactions among industries, and the formation of a distinctive and competitive industrial complex. Typically, a characteristic industry system consists of three tiers: the core industry, related industries, and supporting industries. The core industry serves as the dominant force of the system, while the related and supporting industries provide necessary complementary services and support.#### Definition of Characteristic Industry System

A characteristic industry system is defined as an integrated industrial ecosystem that is centered around a specific industry and operates within a certain geographical region. This system is characterized by its distinctiveness and competitive advantages, which stem from the extension of industrial chains, the synergy and complementarity among industries, and the formation of a cohesive industrial complex.

The core industry within a characteristic industry system is the primary driver of the ecosystem. It encompasses the main activities and value creation processes that are unique to the region. The core industry sets the stage for the development of related industries, which are enterprises and activities that are closely associated with the core industry but do not directly fall under its umbrella. These related industries provide complementary products or services that enhance the core industry's competitiveness.

Supporting industries are those that provide essential services and infrastructure to both the core and related industries. They include sectors such as logistics, finance, technology, and human resources. Supporting industries ensure the smooth operation of the characteristic industry system by offering the necessary support services that enable the core and related industries to thrive.

The key components of a characteristic industry system can be visualized using a Mermaid flowchart:
