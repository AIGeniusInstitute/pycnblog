### 2.6.2 Inventory Optimization Models

Inventory optimization models aim to determine the optimal inventory levels and order quantities that minimize costs and maximize service levels. The following are some commonly used inventory optimization models:

#### 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model

The EOQ model determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total inventory costs, including ordering costs, holding costs, and shortage costs. The formula for the EOQ model is:

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DC}{h}}
$$

Where:
- $Q^*$ is the optimal order quantity.
- $D$ is the annual demand.
- $C$ is the cost per order.
- $h$ is the holding cost per unit per year.

#### 2. Reorder Point (ROP) Model

The ROP model determines the inventory level at which a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts. The formula for the ROP model is:

$$
ROP = L \cdot S - D \cdot L
$$

Where:
- $ROP$ is the reorder point.
- $L$ is the lead time.
- $S$ is the safety stock level.
- $D$ is the demand during the lead time.

#### 3. Just-In-Time (JIT) Model

The JIT model aims to minimize inventory levels by ordering and receiving materials or products just in time to meet production or customer demand. The JIT model requires close coordination with suppliers and accurate demand forecasting to ensure that materials are available when needed.

### 2.6.3 Optimization Models

Optimization models are used to solve complex inventory management problems with multiple constraints and objectives. The following are some commonly used optimization models:

#### 1. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) Model

MILP is a powerful optimization technique that combines linear programming with integer programming. It is used to solve complex inventory management problems with binary and integer decision variables. The general form of an MILP model is:

$$
\text{minimize} \quad c^T x
$$

subject to

$$
Ax \leq b, \quad x \in \{0, 1\}^n
$$

Where:
- $c^T$ is the vector of coefficients for the objective function.
- $x$ is the vector of decision variables.
- $A$ is the constraint matrix.
- $b$ is the vector of right-hand-side values.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Model

Dynamic programming is a method for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. It is particularly useful for solving inventory management problems with time-varying demand and costs. The general form of a dynamic programming model is:

$$
x_t = \arg \min_{x_t} \quad f(x_t, x_{t-1}, ..., x_0)
$$

subject to

$$
g(x_t, x_{t-1}, ..., x_0) = 0
$$

Where:
- $x_t$ is the decision variable at time $t$.
- $f(x_t, x_{t-1}, ..., x_0)$ is the objective function.
- $g(x_t, x_{t-1}, ..., x_0)$ is the constraint function.
