### Mathematical Models and Formulas

#### Key Mathematical Models in Smart Home System Architecture

1. **Energy Optimization Model**:

$$
\min E = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i \cdot t_i)
$$

where $E$ is the total energy consumption, $P_i$ is the power consumption of device $i$, and $t_i$ is the time of usage for device $i$.

2. **Routing Optimization Model**:

$$
\min C = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_i \cdot p_i)
$$

where $C$ is the total communication cost, $d_i$ is the distance between nodes $i$ and $i+1$, and $p_i$ is the communication rate.

3. **Security Model**:

$$
\max S = \frac{1}{1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n} (r_i \cdot p_i)}
$$

where $S$ is the system security level, $r_i$ is the risk level of device $i$, and $p_i$ is the probability of device $i$ being compromised.

#### Detailed Explanation and Examples

1. **Energy Optimization Example**:

Consider a smart home with three devices (A, B, and C) with power consumptions of 100W, 200W, and 300W, respectively. If devices A and B are used for 5 hours and device C is used for 3 hours, the total energy consumption is:

$$
E = (100 \cdot 5) + (200 \cdot 5) + (300 \cdot 3) = 1500 \text{Wh}
$$

2. **Routing Optimization Example**:

In a smart home network with three nodes (A, B, and C), where the distances between nodes are 1km, 2km, and 1km, respectively, and the communication rates are 1Mbps, 2Mbps, and 1Mbps, the total communication cost is:

$$
C = (1 \cdot 1) + (2 \cdot 2) + (1 \cdot 1) = 7 \text{Mbps}
$$

3. **Security Example**:

Assuming three devices (A, B, and C) with risk levels of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.2, and probabilities of being compromised as 0.05, 0.1, and 0.05, the system security level is:

$$
S = \frac{1}{1 - (0.1 \cdot 0.05 + 0.3 \cdot 0.1 + 0.2 \cdot 0.05)} = 0.947
$$

### Project Practice: Code Examples and Detailed Explanations

#### 5.1 Development Environment Setup

To implement a smart home system, we need to set up the development environment, which includes installing necessary software, libraries, and tools. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Python 3.x (version 3.8 or higher) on your system.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
3. Install a smart home simulation library (e.g., HomeAssistant):
```
pip install homeassistant
```

#### 5.2 Source Code Detailed Implementation

Below is a Python script that demonstrates the implementation of a basic smart home system using the HomeAssistant library:

```python
import homeassistant as ha
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize HomeAssistant
ha.initialize()

# Create devices
light = ha.Device("Light", "ON")
thermostat = ha.Device("Thermostat", "AUTO")
security_camera = ha.Device("Security Camera", "OFF")

# Create a system
system = ha.System([light, thermostat, security_camera])

# Define device behavior
def light_behavior():
    if np.random.random() > 0.5:
        light.turn_on()
    else:
        light.turn_off()

def thermostat_behavior():
    if np.random.random() > 0.5:
        thermostat.set_mode("HEAT")
    else:
        thermostat.set_mode("COOL")

def security_camera_behavior():
    if np.random.random() > 0.5:
        security_camera.start_recording()
    else:
        security_camera.stop_recording()

# Simulate device behavior
for _ in range(10):
    light_behavior()
    thermostat_behavior()
    security_camera_behavior()

# Visualize device states
device_states = [device.state for device in system.devices]
plt.bar(range(len(device_states)), device_states)
plt.xlabel("Devices")
plt.ylabel("State")
plt.title("Device States")
plt.show()
```

#### 5.3 Code Explanation and Analysis

1. **Import Libraries**: The script imports the necessary libraries for the HomeAssistant simulation, data manipulation, and visualization.

2. **Initialize HomeAssistant**: The HomeAssistant library is initialized, which sets up the environment for simulating smart home devices.

3. **Create Devices**: Three devices (Light, Thermostat, and Security Camera) are created with initial states (ON, AUTO, and OFF).

4. **Create System**: A smart home system is created with the three devices.

5. **Define Device Behavior**: Three functions (light_behavior(), thermostat_behavior(), and security_camera_behavior()) define the behavior of each device. These functions use random values to simulate real-world behavior.

6. **Simulate Device Behavior**: The script simulates the behavior of the devices for 10 iterations, updating the device states accordingly.

7. **Visualize Device States**: The final device states are visualized using a bar chart, providing a clear representation of the system's state at the end of the simulation.
