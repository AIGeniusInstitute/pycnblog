### Core Concepts and Connections

#### Key Algorithm Concepts

To effectively tackle algorithm questions in Xiaomi's campus recruitment interviews, it is essential to have a solid understanding of several key algorithm concepts. These concepts form the foundation for solving complex problems efficiently and optimally. Here are some of the core algorithm concepts you need to be familiar with:

1. **Time Complexity**: Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm.
2. **Space Complexity**: Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. This is crucial for understanding the scalability of an algorithm.
3. **Data Structures**: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
4. **Sorting Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange the elements of a list in a specific order. Examples include bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and selection sort.
5. **Searching Algorithms**: Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in a data structure. Examples include linear search and binary search.
6. **Graph Algorithms**: Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, which are data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Examples include Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm.

#### Interrelationships Between Concepts

Understanding the interrelationships between these concepts is crucial for effective algorithm design and analysis. Here are some key connections:

1. **Time Complexity and Data Structures**: The choice of data structure can significantly affect the time complexity of an algorithm. For example, binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) on a sorted array, whereas linear search has a time complexity of O(n).
2. **Space Complexity and Time Complexity**: While optimizing for time complexity is important, it is also necessary to consider space complexity. In some cases, a more space-efficient algorithm may be preferred over a faster one if memory usage is a constraint.
3. **Sorting and Searching**: Many searching algorithms rely on sorted data structures. Sorting algorithms are often used as preprocessing steps to improve the efficiency of searching algorithms.
4. **Graph Algorithms and Data Structures**: Graph algorithms often require the use of specific data structures, such as adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, to efficiently represent and traverse graphs.

#### Mermaid Flowchart of Core Concepts

To provide a visual representation of the core concepts and their interrelationships, we can use a Mermaid flowchart. Here's an example of how this flowchart might look:

#### Step-by-Step Procedures for Solving Algorithm Questions

Below, we provide detailed step-by-step procedures for solving some of these common algorithm questions, along with explanations and code examples where applicable.

##### 1. Find the Maximum Subarray Sum

**Question**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the array.

**Algorithm**: Kadane's Algorithm

**Steps**:

1. Initialize `max_so_far = 0` and `max_ending_here = 0`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - For each element `arr[i]`, update `max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])`.
   - Update `max_so_far` with the maximum value between `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
3. Return `max_so_far` as the result.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_so_far = 0
    max_ending_here = 0
    for num in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

# Example usage
arr = [1, -3, 2, 1, -1]
print(max_subarray_sum(arr))  # Output: 3 (subarray: [2, 1])
```

##### 2. Find the Longest Common Subsequence

**Question**: Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence among them.

**Algorithm**: Dynamic Programming

**Steps**:

1. Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings.
2. Initialize the first row and first column of `dp` with zeros.
3. Iterate through the characters of the two strings:
   - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
4. The length of the longest common subsequence is `dp[m][n]`.
5. To find the actual subsequence, start from `dp[m][n]` and backtrack through the `dp` array.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    # Backtrack to find the actual subsequence
    result = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
            result.append(text1[i-1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    
    return ''.join(result[::-1])

# Example usage
text1 = "ABCD"
text2 = "ACDF"
print(longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2))  # Output: "ACD"
```

##### 3. Implement a Stack Using Queues

**Question**: Implement a stack using two queues, with operations such as push, pop, and top.

**Algorithm**: Using Two Queues

**Steps**:

1. Create two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`.
2. For `push` operation:
   - Enqueue the element into `queue2`.
   - Move all elements from `queue1` to `queue2`.
   - Swap the names of `queue1` and `queue2`.
3. For `pop` operation:
   - Dequeue the front element from `queue1`.
4. For `top` operation:
   - Return the front element of `queue1`.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
from collections import deque

class StackWithQueues:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue1 = deque()
        self.queue2 = deque()

    def push(self, x):
        self.queue2.append(x)
        while self.queue1:
            self.queue2.append(self.queue1.popleft())
        self.queue1, self.queue2 = self.queue2, self.queue1

    def pop(self):
        return self.queue1.popleft()

    def top(self):
        return self.queue1[0]

# Example usage
stack = StackWithQueues()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.top())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
```

##### 4. Reverse a Linked List

**Question**: Reverse the nodes of a singly linked list.

**Algorithm**: Iterative and Recursive Methods

**Steps** (Iterative Method):

1. Initialize three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.
2. Set `previous` to `None` and `current` to the head of the linked list.
3. Iterate through the linked list:
   - Set `next` to the next node of `current`.
   - Set `current.next` to `previous`.
   - Move `previous` to `current` and `current` to `next`.
4. Return `previous` as the new head of the reversed linked list.

**Steps** (Recursive Method):

1. If the current node is `None`, return `None`.
2. Recursively reverse the remaining list.
3. Set the `next` of the last node to the current node.
4. Set the `next` of the current node to `None`.
5. Return the reversed list.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
# Iterative Method
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverse_linked_list_iterative(head):
    previous = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next = current.next
        current.next = previous
        previous = current
        current = next
    return previous

# Recursive Method
def reverse_linked_list_recursive(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    new_head = reverse_linked_list_recursive(head.next)
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = None
    return new_head

# Example usage
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)
reversed_head = reverse_linked_list_iterative(head)
print(reversed_head.val, reversed_head.next.val, reversed_head.next.next.val)  # Output: 3 2 1
```

##### 5. Binary Search

**Question**: Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the target value using binary search.

**Algorithm**: Divide and Conquer

**Steps**:

1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. While `low <= high`:
   - Calculate the middle index as `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, return `mid`.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] > target`, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
3. If the target value is not found, return -1.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 4
print(binary_search(arr, target))  # Output: 3
```

##### 6. Implement a Queue Using Stacks

**Question**: Implement a queue using two stacks, with operations such as enqueue and dequeue.

**Algorithm**: Using Two Stacks

**Steps**:

1. Create two stacks, `stack1` and `stack2`.
2. For `enqueue` operation:
   - Push the element into `stack1`.
3. For `dequeue` operation:
   - If `stack2` is empty, move all elements from `stack1` to `stack2` by popping from `stack1` and pushing to `stack2`.
   - Pop the top element from `stack2`.
4. For `peek` operation:
   - If `stack2` is empty, move all elements from `stack1` to `stack2` by popping from `stack1` and pushing to `stack2`.
   - Return the top element of `stack2`.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
from collections import deque

class QueueWithStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = deque()
        self.stack2 = deque()

    def enqueue(self, x):
        self.stack1.append(x)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2[-1]

# Example usage
queue = QueueWithStacks()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.peek())  # Output: 1
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
```

##### 7. Implement a Binary Tree Traversal

**Question**: Implement various binary tree traversals, such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.

**Algorithm**: Recursive and Iterative Methods

**Steps** (Recursive Method):

1. For pre-order traversal:
   - Visit the root node.
   - Recursively traverse the left subtree.
   - Recursively traverse the right subtree.
2. For in-order traversal:
   - Recursively traverse the left subtree.
   - Visit the root node.
   - Recursively traverse the right subtree.
3. For post-order traversal:
   - Recursively traverse the left subtree.
   - Recursively traverse the right subtree.
   - Visit the root node.

**Steps** (Iterative Method):

1. For pre-order traversal:
   - Initialize an empty stack.
   - Push the root node onto the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty:
     - Pop the top node from the stack.
     - Process the node.
     - Push the right child of the node onto the stack (if it exists).
     - Push the left child of the node onto the stack (if it exists).
2. For in-order and post-order traversals:
   - The steps are similar to the recursive method, but instead of using recursion, you use a stack to simulate the recursive calls.

**Code Example** (Python):

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pre_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.val, end=' ')
    pre_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    pre_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)

def in_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    in_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    print(root.val, end=' ')
    in_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)

def post_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    post_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    post_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)
    print(root.val, end=' ')

# Example usage
# Create a binary tree
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

# Perform traversals
print("Pre-order (Recursive):")
pre_order_traversal_recursive(root)
print("\nIn-order (Recursive):")
in_order_traversal_recursive(root)
print("\nPost-order (Recursive):")
post_order_traversal_recursive(root)

# Output:
# Pre-order (Recursive):
# 1 2 4 5 3
# In-order (Recursive):
# 4 2 5 1 3
# Post-order (Recursive):
# 4 5 2 3 1

# Iterative implementations (omitted for brevity)
```

By understanding and applying these core algorithm principles and specific operational steps, candidates can effectively solve common algorithm questions in Xiaomi's campus recruitment interviews. In the next section, we will delve into mathematical models and formulas commonly used in algorithm design, along with detailed explanations and examples.

### Mathematical Models and Formulas & Detailed Explanation & Examples

#### Introduction to Mathematical Models and Formulas

Mathematical models and formulas are crucial in the field of algorithms. They help in analyzing the efficiency, correctness, and performance of algorithms. By understanding these models and formulas, candidates can better design and optimize algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.

#### Common Mathematical Models and Formulas in Algorithm Design

Here are some of the most common mathematical models and formulas used in algorithm design, along with their detailed explanations and examples:

##### 1. Time Complexity

Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm. The most common time complexity notations are:

- **O-notation (Big O)**: This notation provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity. It indicates the worst-case scenario.
- **Ω-notation (Big Omega)**: This notation provides a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity. It indicates the best-case scenario.
- **Θ-notation (Big Theta)**: This notation provides both an upper and a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity. It indicates the average-case scenario.

**Example**: Consider the following function:

```python
def example_function(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(i + j)
```

- The time complexity of this function is \(O(n^2)\) because the number of print statements grows quadratically with the input size `n`.
- The best-case time complexity is \(Ω(1)\) because the function will always execute at least one iteration, regardless of the input size.
- The average-case time complexity is \(Θ(n^2)\) because the function will execute approximately \(n^2\) print statements on average.

##### 2. Space Complexity

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. It helps in analyzing the scalability of an algorithm. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is also expressed using notations such as O, Ω, and Θ.

**Example**: Consider the following function:

```python
def example_function(n):
    arr = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = i * i
```

- The space complexity of this function is \(O(n)\) because the memory used by the array `arr` grows linearly with the input size `n`.
- The best-case space complexity is \(Ω(1)\) because the function will always use a constant amount of memory, regardless of the input size.
- The average-case space complexity is \(Θ(n)\) because the function will use approximately `n` memory cells on average.

##### 3. Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notations are used to describe the growth rate of functions. The most commonly used notations are:

- **Little-o (o)**: This notation indicates that a function grows strictly slower than another function.
- **Little-omega (ω)**: This notation indicates that a function grows strictly faster than another function.
- **Big-o (O)**: This notation indicates an upper bound on the growth rate of a function.
- **Big-omega (Ω)**: This notation indicates a lower bound on the growth rate of a function.
- **Big-theta (Θ)**: This notation indicates both an upper and a lower bound on the growth rate of a function.

**Example**: Consider the following functions:

```python
f(n) = n^2
g(n) = 2^n
h(n) = n * log(n)
```

- \(f(n) = O(g(n))\) because \(f(n)\) grows strictly slower than \(g(n)\).
- \(g(n) = Ω(f(n))\) because \(g(n)\) grows strictly faster than \(f(n)\).
- \(h(n) = Θ(g(n))\) because \(h(n)\) has both an upper and a lower bound equal to \(g(n)\).

##### 4. Recurrence Relations

Recurrence relations are equations that define a sequence recursively. They are commonly used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms that involve recursive calls.

**Example**: Consider the following recurrence relation:

```python
T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2
```

- The base case is \(T(1) = 1\).
- To find the solution, we can use the Master Theorem, which provides a way to solve recurrence relations of the form \(T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)\).
- In this case, \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(f(n) = n^2\).
- According to the Master Theorem, if \(f(n) = Θ(n^{\log_b a + ε})\) for some constant \(ε > 0\), then \(T(n) = Θ(n^{\log_b a} \log n)\).
- In this example, \(ε = 1\), so \(T(n) = Θ(n^2 \log n)\).

##### 5. Big O Hierarchy

The Big O hierarchy provides a way to compare the growth rates of different functions. Here are some common functions and their relative growth rates:

- \(O(1)\) (constant time): Functions that take a constant amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.
- \(O(\log n)\) (logarithmic time): Functions that grow logarithmically with the input size.
- \(O(n)\) (linear time): Functions that grow linearly with the input size.
- \(O(n \log n)\) (linearithmic time): Functions that grow faster than linear time but slower than polynomial time.
- \(O(n^2)\) (quadratic time): Functions that grow quadratically with the input size.
- \(O(n^3)\) (cubic time): Functions that grow cubically with the input size.
- \(O(2^n)\) (exponential time): Functions that grow exponentially with the input size.

**Example**: Consider the following functions:

```python
f(n) = n
g(n) = n^2
h(n) = n * log(n)
i(n) = 2^n
```

- \(f(n) = O(n)\) because it grows linearly with the input size.
- \(g(n) = O(n^2)\) because it grows quadratically with the input size.
- \(h(n) = O(n \log n)\) because it grows faster than linear time but slower than quadratic time.
- \(i(n) = O(2^n)\) because it grows exponentially with the input size.

By understanding these mathematical models and formulas, candidates can analyze and optimize algorithms more effectively. In the next section, we will explore real-world applications of the algorithms discussed and their relevance to practical scenarios.

#### Code Example 1: Maximum Subarray Sum

**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the array.

**Algorithm**: Kadane's Algorithm

**Python Code Example**:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    max_ending_here = 0
    for num in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(num, max_ending_here + num)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

# Test the function
arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_sum(arr))  # Output: 6 (subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1])
```

**Explanation**:
1. We initialize `max_so_far` to negative infinity and `max_ending_here` to 0.
2. We iterate through the array, updating `max_ending_here` by taking the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `max_ending_here`.
3. We update `max_so_far` with the maximum value between the current `max_so_far` and the updated `max_ending_here`.
4. Finally, we return `max_so_far` as the result.

#### Code Example 2: Longest Common Subsequence

**Problem Description**: Given two strings, find the longest common subsequence among them.

**Algorithm**: Dynamic Programming

**Python Code Example**:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])

    result = []
    i, j = m, n
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
            result.append(text1[i-1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    return ''.join(result[::-1])

# Test the function
text1 = "ABCD"
text2 = "ACDF"
print(longest_common_subsequence(text1, text2))  # Output: "ACD"
```

**Explanation**:
1. We create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` and initialize it with zeros.
2. We iterate through the characters of the two strings and update the `dp` array according to the dynamic programming approach.
3. We start from the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array and backtrack to construct the longest common subsequence.
4. Finally, we return the reversed subsequence as the result.

#### Code Example 3: Implement a Stack Using Queues

**Problem Description**: Implement a stack using two queues, with operations such as push, pop, and top.

**Algorithm**: Using Two Queues

**Python Code Example**:

```python
from collections import deque

class StackWithQueues:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue1 = deque()
        self.queue2 = deque()

    def push(self, x):
        self.queue2.append(x)
        while self.queue1:
            self.queue2.append(self.queue1.popleft())
        self.queue1, self.queue2 = self.queue2, self.queue1

    def pop(self):
        return self.queue1.popleft()

    def top(self):
        return self.queue1[0]

# Test the stack
stack = StackWithQueues()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.top())  # Output: 3
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 3
```

**Explanation**:
1. We create two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`.
2. For the `push` operation, we append the element to `queue2` and then move all elements from `queue1` to `queue2`. Finally, we swap the names of `queue1` and `queue2`.
3. For the `pop` operation, we simply pop the front element from `queue1`.
4. For the `top` operation, we return the front element of `queue1`.

#### Code Example 4: Reverse a Linked List

**Problem Description**: Reverse the nodes of a singly linked list.

**Algorithm**: Iterative and Recursive Methods

**Python Code Example** (Iterative Method):

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverse_linked_list_iterative(head):
    previous = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next = current.next
        current.next = previous
        previous = current
        current = next
    return previous

# Test the function
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)
reversed_head = reverse_linked_list_iterative(head)
print(reversed_head.val, reversed_head.next.val, reversed_head.next.next.val)  # Output: 3 2 1
```

**Explanation**:
1. We initialize three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.
2. We iterate through the linked list, updating the `next` pointers to reverse the direction of the list.
3. We return `previous` as the new head of the reversed linked list.

#### Code Example 5: Binary Search

**Problem Description**: Given a sorted array and a target value, find the index of the target value using binary search.

**Algorithm**: Divide and Conquer

**Python Code Example**:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Test the function
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 4
print(binary_search(arr, target))  # Output: 3
```

**Explanation**:
1. We initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. We repeatedly calculate the middle index as `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
3. If `arr[mid]` is equal to the target value, we return `mid`.
4. If `arr[mid]` is less than the target value, we update `low` to `mid + 1`.
5. If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target value, we update `high` to `mid - 1`.
6. If the target value is not found, we return -1.

#### Code Example 6: Implement a Queue Using Stacks

**Problem Description**: Implement a queue using two stacks, with operations such as enqueue and dequeue.

**Algorithm**: Using Two Stacks

**Python Code Example**:

```python
from collections import deque

class QueueWithStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = deque()
        self.stack2 = deque()

    def enqueue(self, x):
        self.stack1.append(x)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.stack2:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2[-1]

# Test the queue
queue = QueueWithStacks()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.peek())  # Output: 1
print(queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1
```

**Explanation**:
1. We create two stacks, `stack1` and `stack2`.
2. For the `enqueue` operation, we simply append the element to `stack1`.
3. For the `dequeue` operation, if `stack2` is empty, we move all elements from `stack1` to `stack2`. Then, we pop the front element from `stack2`.
4. For the `peek` operation, if `stack2` is empty, we move all elements from `stack1` to `stack2`. Then, we return the front element of `stack2`.

#### Code Example 7: Implement a Binary Tree Traversal

**Problem Description**: Implement various binary tree traversals, such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.

**Algorithm**: Recursive and Iterative Methods

**Python Code Example** (Recursive Method):

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pre_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.val, end=' ')
    pre_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    pre_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)

def in_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    in_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    print(root.val, end=' ')
    in_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)

def post_order_traversal_recursive(root):
    if not root:
        return
    post_order_traversal_recursive(root.left)
    post_order_traversal_recursive(root.right)
    print(root.val, end=' ')

# Test the traversals
# Create a binary tree
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

# Perform traversals
print("Pre-order (Recursive):")
pre_order_traversal_recursive(root)
print("\nIn-order (Recursive):")
in_order_traversal_recursive(root)
print("\nPost-order (Recursive):")
post_order_traversal_recursive(root)

# Output:
# Pre-order (Recursive):
# 1 2 4 5 3
# In-order (Recursive):
# 4 2 5 1 3
# Post-order (Recursive):
# 4 5 2 3 1

# Iterative implementations (omitted for brevity)
```

**Explanation**:
1. For pre-order traversal, we visit the root node, then recursively traverse the left and right subtrees.
2. For in-order traversal, we recursively traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, and then recursively traverse the right subtree.
3. For post-order traversal, we recursively traverse the left and right subtrees, and then visit the root node.
4. We use recursion to implement these traversals, but iterative methods are also possible using stacks or queues.

By understanding and implementing these code examples, readers can gain practical experience with the algorithms discussed. This hands-on experience will help them apply these concepts effectively in real-world scenarios, improving their problem-solving skills and preparing them for technical interviews at Xiaomi and other companies.

### Practical Application Scenarios

#### 1. Maximum Subarray Sum in Stock Trading

One practical application of the maximum subarray sum algorithm is in stock trading. In this scenario, an investor wants to find the best time to buy and sell a stock to maximize their profit. The array of integers represents the stock prices on different days, and the goal is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within this array, which corresponds to the profit from buying and selling the stock on those days.

For example, consider the following array of stock prices:

```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
```

Using Kadane's algorithm, we can find the maximum subarray sum, which represents the maximum profit. In this case, the maximum profit is 7 (buy on day 2 and sell on day 5).

The application of the maximum subarray sum algorithm in stock trading demonstrates how efficient algorithm design can lead to better decision-making and potentially higher profits.

#### 2. Longest Common Subsequence in Text Comparison

Another practical application of the longest common subsequence algorithm is in text comparison. This algorithm can be used to find the longest common subsequence between two strings, which can be useful in various scenarios, such as spell checking, text deduplication, and version control.

For example, consider the following two strings:

```python
text1 = "ABCDGH"
text2 = "AEDFHR"
```

Using dynamic programming, we can find the longest common subsequence between these two strings, which is "ADH". This information can be used to identify similarities between texts and improve the accuracy of spell checkers or text deduplication tools.

#### 3. Implementing a Stack Using Queues in Real-Time Systems

Implementing a stack using queues is a practical approach in real-time systems where memory usage is a critical concern. In such systems, efficient resource management is essential to ensure smooth operation and avoid performance bottlenecks.

For example, in a network packet processing system, incoming packets need to be stored and processed in the order they arrive. By implementing a stack using two queues, we can achieve efficient memory management and ensure that packets are processed in the correct order without consuming excessive memory.

#### 4. Reversing a Linked List in Database Management Systems

Reversing a linked list is a useful operation in database management systems, particularly when maintaining data integrity and optimizing query performance. For instance, in a database that uses a linked list to store data, reversing the linked list can improve the efficiency of certain types of queries, such as range queries or reverse-sequential queries.

By understanding and applying these algorithms in practical scenarios, developers and data scientists can enhance their problem-solving abilities and develop more efficient and effective solutions for real-world problems.
