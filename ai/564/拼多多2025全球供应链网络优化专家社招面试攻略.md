The linear programming (LP) model is widely used in supply chain optimization to solve resource allocation problems. It involves maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints.

**4.2.1 Formulation of the Linear Programming Model**

The general form of a linear programming model can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize or Minimize} \quad & c^T x \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & Ax \leq b \\
& x \geq 0
\end{align*}
$$

where:

- \( c \) is a vector of cost coefficients representing the objective function.
- \( x \) is a vector of decision variables representing the quantities to be optimized.
- \( A \) is a matrix of constraint coefficients representing the constraints.
- \( b \) is a vector of constraint constants representing the right-hand side of the constraints.

**4.2.2 Example: Production Planning using Linear Programming**

Consider a company that produces three products: A, B, and C. The company has a total of 100 hours of production time available each day. The production time required for each product and the profit per unit are as follows:

| Product | Production Time (hours) | Profit per Unit ($) |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| A       | 3                       | 20                  |
| B       | 2                       | 15                  |
| C       | 4                       | 12                  |

The company wants to maximize its profit while ensuring that the total production time does not exceed 100 hours. The linear programming model can be formulated as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize} \quad & 20x_A + 15x_B + 12x_C \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & 3x_A + 2x_B + 4x_C \leq 100 \\
& x_A, x_B, x_C \geq 0
\end{align*}
$$

**4.2.3 Solving the Linear Programming Problem**

- **Step 3:** Apply the simplex algorithm to iteratively improve the solution until an optimal solution is reached.

After solving the problem, we find that the optimal solution is \( x_A = 20 \), \( x_B = 0 \), \( x_C = 10 \), and the maximum profit is \( \$520 \).

**4.3 Transportation Problem**

The transportation problem is a special type of linear programming problem that involves finding the optimal allocation of goods from a set of sources to a set of destinations while minimizing transportation costs.

**4.3.1 Formulation of the Transportation Problem**

The general form of the transportation problem can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{ij} x_{ij} \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ij} = a_i \quad \forall i = 1, 2, \ldots, m \\
& \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} = b_j \quad \forall j = 1, 2, \ldots, n \\
& x_{ij} \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j
\end{align*}
$$

where:

- \( c_{ij} \) is the cost per unit of transportation from source \( i \) to destination \( j \).
- \( a_i \) is the supply at source \( i \).
- \( b_j \) is the demand at destination \( j \).

| Plant 3            | 150            | 300            | \$6                          |
| Distribution 1     | -              | 150            | \$3                          |
| Distribution 2     | -              | 200            | \$2                          |
| Distribution 3     | -              | 250            | \$4                          |
| Distribution 4     | -              | 300            | \$5                          |

The company wants to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demand at each distribution center. The transportation problem can be formulated as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize} \quad & 5x_{11} + 4x_{12} + 6x_{13} + 3x_{21} + 2x_{22} + 4x_{23} + 5x_{31} \\
\text{Subject to} \quad & x_{11} + x_{21} + x_{31} = 300 \\
& x_{12} + x_{22} + x_{32} = 200 \\
& x_{13} + x_{23} + x_{33} = 150 \\
& x_{11} + x_{12} + x_{13} = 150 \\
& x_{21} + x_{22} + x_{23} = 200 \\
& x_{31} + x_{32} + x_{33} = 300 \\
& x_{ij} \geq 0 \quad \forall i, j
\end{align*}
$$

After solving the problem using the transportation simplex method, we find the optimal solution:

| Source/Destination | Supply (units) | Demand (units) | Transportation Cost (per unit) | Amount Transferred (units) |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Plant 1            | 300            | 200            | \$5                          | 200                        |
| Plant 2            | 200            | 250            | \$4                          | 200                        |
| Plant 3            | 150            | 300            | \$6                          | 150                        |
| Distribution 1     | -              | 150            | \$3                          | 150                        |
| Distribution 2     | -              | 200            | \$2                          | 200                        |
| Distribution 3     | -              | 250            | \$4                          | 250                        |
| Distribution 4     | -              | 300            | \$5                          | 300                        |

The total transportation cost is minimized to \$3,900.

**4.4 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model**

The economic order quantity (EOQ) model is used to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, including ordering costs, holding costs, and shortage costs.

**4.4.1 Formulation of the EOQ Model**

The EOQ model can be formulated as follows:

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DC}{H}}
$$

where:

- \( Q^* \) is the optimal order quantity.
- \( D \) is the annual demand for the item.
- \( C \) is the cost per order.
- \( H \) is the holding cost per unit per year.

**4.4.2 Example: EOQ Model in Inventory Management**

Consider an item with an annual demand of 5,000 units, a cost per order of \$50, and a holding cost of \$2 per unit per year. The EOQ can be calculated as:

$$
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 5,000 \times 50}{2}} = 500 \text{ units}
$$

Ordering 500 units at a time will minimize the total inventory costs.

**5.4 Code Explanation and Analysis**

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** We start by loading the supply chain data from a CSV file. The data includes the annual demand, cost per order, and holding cost for various products.
- **Demand and Cost Parameters:** We define the demand \( D \), cost per order \( C \), and holding cost \( H \) as parameters for the optimization problem.
- **Objective Function:** The objective function represents the total cost, which includes holding costs and ordering costs. The goal is to minimize this cost.
- **Constraints:** The constraints ensure that the order quantity \( Q \) is non-negative and does not exceed the annual demand \( D \).
- **Optimization:** We use the `minimize` function from the Scipy library to solve the optimization problem. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) method is employed.
- **Results and Visualization:** We print the optimal order quantity and plot the objective function to visualize the total cost as a function of the order quantity.

**5.5 Running the Code**

Save the code in a Python file named `supply_chain_optimization.py` and run it using the following command:

```bash
python supply_chain_optimization.py
```

You should see the output displaying the optimal order quantity and a plot of the objective function.

### 6. Practical Application Scenarios

**6.1 Enhancing Supply Chain Efficiency**

One practical application of supply chain optimization is enhancing the efficiency of supply chain operations. This can involve optimizing procurement processes, production planning, inventory management, and logistics.
